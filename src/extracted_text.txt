Introduction
Chapter Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Distinguish between anatomy and physiology, and identify several branches of each
• Describethestructureofthebody,fromsimplesttomostcomplex,intermsofthesixlevelsoforganization
• Identify the functional characteristics of human life
• Identify the four requirements for human survival
• Define homeostasis and explain its importance to normal human functioning
• Useappropriateanatomicalterminologytoidentifykeybodystructures,bodyregions,anddirectionsinthe
body
• Compare and contrast at least four medical imagining techniques in terms of their function and use in
medicine
Though you may approach a course in anatomy and physiology strictly as a requirement for your field of study, the
knowledge you gain in this course will serve you well in many aspects of your life. An understanding of anatomy and
physiology is not only fundamental to any career in the health professions, but it can also benefit your own health.

1.1 | Overview of Anatomy and Physiology
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Compare and contrast anatomy and physiology, including their specializations and methods of study
• Discuss the fundamental relationship between anatomy and physiology
Human anatomy is the scientific study of the body’s structures. Some of these structures are very small and can only
be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen, manipulated,
measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.” Human anatomy was
firststudiedbyobservingtheexteriorofthebodyandobservingthewoundsofsoldiersandotherinjuries.Later,physicians
wereallowedtodissectbodiesofthedeadtoaugmenttheirknowledge.Whenabodyisdissected,itsstructuresarecutapart

techniqueshavebeendeveloped.Thesetechniquesallowclinicianstovisualizestructuresinsidethelivingbodysuchasa

oncarefullydesignedlaboratoryexperimentsthatrevealthefunctionsofthemanystructuresandchemicalcompoundsthat
make up the human body.
Like anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology is
thestudyofthebrain,spinalcord,andnervesandhowtheseworktogethertoperformfunctionsascomplexanddiverseas
vision,movement,andthinking.Physiologistsmayworkfromtheorganlevel(exploring,forexample,whatdifferentparts
of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels along nerves).

the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.
Your study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate the form of the structures you are
studying to their function. In fact, it can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an understanding
ofthephysiologythatabodystructuresupports.Imagine,forexample,tryingtoappreciatetheuniquearrangementofthe
bones of the human hand if you had no conception of the function of the hand. Fortunately, your understanding of how
the human hand manipulates tools—from pens to cell phones—helps you appreciate the unique alignment of the thumb
in opposition to the four fingers, making your hand a structure that allows you to pinch and grasp objects and type text
messages.
1.2 | Structural Organization of the Human Body
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the structure of the human body in terms of six levels of organization
• List the eleven organ systems of the human body and identify at least one organ and one major function of each
Before you begin to study the different structures and functions of the human body, it is helpful to consider its basic
architecture;thatis,howitssmallestpartsareassembledintolargerstructures.Itisconvenienttoconsiderthestructuresof

The Levels of Organization
Tostudythechemicalleveloforganization,scientistsconsiderthesimplestbuildingblocksofmatter:subatomicparticles,
atoms and molecules. All matter in the universe is composed of one or more unique pure substances called elements,
familiar examples of which are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, and iron. The smallest unit of any of these

Molecules are the chemical building blocks of all body structures.
A cell is the smallest independently functioning unit of a living organism. Even bacteria, which are extremely small,
independently-living organisms, have a cellular structure. Each bacterium is a single cell. All living structures of human
anatomy contain cells, and almost all functions of human physiology are performed in cells or are initiated by cells.
A human cell typically consists of flexible membranes that enclose cytoplasm, a water-based cellular fluid together with

Organization
A human body consists of trillions of cells organized in a way that maintains distinct internal compartments. These
compartmentskeepbodycellsseparatedfromexternalenvironmentalthreatsandkeepthecellsmoistandnourished.They
also separate internal body fluids from the countless microorganisms that grow on body surfaces, including the lining of
certain tracts, or passageways. The intestinal tract, for example, is home to even more bacteria cells than the total of all
human cells in the body, yet these bacteria are outside the body and cannot be allowed to circulate freely inside the body.
Cells, for example, have a cell membrane (also referred to as the plasma membrane) that keeps the intracellular
environment—the fluids and organelles—separate from the extracellular environment. Blood vessels keep blood inside
a closed circulatory system, and nerves and muscles are wrapped in connective tissue sheaths that separate them from
surrounding structures. In the chest and abdomen, a variety of internal membranes keep major organs such as the lungs,
heart, and kidneys separate from others.
The body’s largest organ system is the integumentary system, which includes the skin and its associated structures, such
ashairandnails.Thesurfacetissueofskinisabarrierthatprotectsinternalstructuresandfluidsfrompotentiallyharmful
microorganisms and other toxins.

Responsiveness
Responsiveness is the ability of an organism to adjust to changes in its internal and external environments. An example
of responsiveness to external stimuli could include moving toward sources of food and water and away from perceived
dangers.Changesinanorganism’sinternal environment, suchasincreased bodytemperature, cancausetheresponsesof
sweating and the dilation of blood vessels in the skin in order to decrease body temperature, as shown by the runners in

Movement
Human movement includes not only actions at the joints of the body, but also the motion of individual organs and even
individual cells. As you read these words, red and white blood cells are moving throughout your body, muscle cells are

then be used in the metabolic processes that convert them to ATP. Although you might feel as if you are starving after
missing a single meal, you can survive without consuming the energy-yielding nutrients for at least several weeks.
Water and the energy-yielding nutrients are also referred to as macronutrients because the body needs them in large
amounts. In contrast, micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. These elements and compounds participate in many

water-soluble and cannot be stored, so you need to consume them every day or two.
Narrow Range of Temperature
Youhaveprobablyseennewsstoriesaboutathleteswhodiedofheatstroke,orhikerswhodiedofexposuretocold.Such
deaths occur because the chemical reactions upon which the body depends can only take place within a narrow range of
body temperature, from just below to just above 37°C (98.6°F). When body temperature rises well above or drops well
below normal, certain proteins (enzymes) that facilitate chemical reactions lose their normal structure andtheir ability to
function and the chemical reactions of metabolism cannot proceed.

that energy reserve is depleted, however, and the core temperature begins to drop significantly, red blood cells will lose
their ability to give up oxygen, denying the brain of this critical component of ATP production. This lack of oxygen can

cause confusion, lethargy, and eventually loss of consciousness and death. The body responds to cold by reducing blood

be permanent and lead to gangrene, requiring amputation of the affected region.
Controlled Hypothermia
As you have learned, the body continuously engages in coordinated physiological processes to maintain a stable
temperature. In some cases, however, overriding this system can be useful, or even life-saving. Hypothermia is the
clinical term for an abnormally low body temperature (hypo- = “below” or “under”). Controlled hypothermia is

Controlledhypothermiaoftenisused,forexample,duringopen-heartsurgerybecauseitdecreasesthemetabolicneeds
of the brain, heart, and other organs, reducing the risk of damage to them. When controlled hypothermia is used
clinically, the patient is given medication to prevent shivering. The body is then cooled to 25–32°C (79–89°F). The

the heart muscle to tolerate its lack of blood supply during the surgery.
Some emergency department physicians use controlled hypothermia to reduce damage to the heart in patients who
have suffered a cardiac arrest. In the emergency department, the physician induces coma and lowers the patient’s
bodytemperaturetoapproximately91degrees.Thiscondition,whichismaintainedfor24hours,slowsthepatient’s
metabolic rate. Because the patient’s organs require less blood to function, the heart’s workload is reduced.
Narrow Range of Atmospheric Pressure
Pressure is a force exerted by a substance that is in contact with another substance. Atmospheric pressure is pressure

bubbles as dissolved gases (in this case, carbon dioxide) come out of solution in the liquid.
The most common symptoms of DCS are pain in the joints, with headache and disturbances of vision occurring in
10 percent to 15 percent of cases. Left untreated, very severe DCS can result in death. Immediate treatment is with
pure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,

1.5 | Homeostasis
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning
• Contrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism
Maintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body temperature to
blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point. A set point is the
physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set of values that is
optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is approximately 37°C
(98.6°F)Physiological parameters, suchasbodytemperature andbloodpressure,tendtofluctuate within anormal range
a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other parts of the body monitor and react to
deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is a mechanism that reverses a deviation from
the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters within their normal range. The maintenance of
homeostasisbynegativefeedbackgoesonthroughoutthebodyatalltimes,andanunderstandingofnegativefeedbackis
thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.
Negative Feedback
A negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a). A sensor, also referred to a receptor, is a
component of a feedback system that monitors a physiological value. This value is reported to the control center. The
controlcenteristhecomponentinafeedbacksystemthatcomparesthevaluetothenormalrange.Ifthevaluedeviatestoo
muchfromthesetpoint,thenthecontrolcenteractivatesaneffector.Aneffectoristhecomponentinafeedbacksystem
that causes a change to reverse the situation and return the value to the normal range.
Figure 1.10 Negative Feedback Loop In a negative feedback loop, a stimulus—a deviation from a set point—is
resistedthroughaphysiologicalprocessthatreturnsthebodytohomeostasis.(a)Anegativefeedbackloophasfour
basic parts. (b) Body temperature is regulated by negative feedback.
In order to set the system in motion, a stimulus must drive a physiological parameter beyond its normal range (that is,
beyondhomeostasis).Thisstimulusis“heard”byaspecificsensor.Forexample,inthecontrolofbloodglucose,specific
endocrinecellsinthepancreasdetectexcessglucose(thestimulus)inthebloodstream.Thesepancreaticbetacellsrespond
totheincreasedlevelofbloodglucosebyreleasingthehormoneinsulinintothebloodstream.Theinsulinsignalsskeletal
muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose, removing it from the bloodstream. As
glucoseconcentrationinthebloodstreamdrops,thedecreaseinconcentration—theactualnegativefeedback—isdetected
by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops. This prevents blood sugar levels from continuing to drop below the
normal range.
Humans have a similar temperature regulation feedback system that works by promoting either heat loss or heat gain
(Figure 1.10b). When the brain’s temperature regulation center receives data from the sensors indicating that the body’s
temperature exceeds its normal range, it stimulates a cluster of brain cells referred to as the “heat-loss center.” This
stimulation has three major effects:

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HUMAN BODY 23

allowing the heat to radiate into the environment.
• Asbloodflowtotheskinincreases,sweatglandsareactivatedtoincreasetheiroutput.Asthesweatevaporatesfrom
the skin surface into the surrounding air, it takes heat with it.
• The depth of respiration increases, and a person may breathe through an open mouth instead of through the nasal

and a (b) posterior view. The regions of the body are labeled in boldface.
A body that is lying down is described as either prone or supine. Prone describes a face-down orientation, and supine
describes a face up orientation. These terms are sometimes used in describing the position of the body during specific
physical examinations or surgical procedures.
Regional Terms

Body Cavities and Serous Membranes
The body maintains its internal organization by means of membranes, sheaths, and other structures that separate
compartments.Thedorsal(posterior)cavityandtheventral(anterior)cavityarethelargestbodycompartments(Figure

• Discuss the uses and drawbacks of X-ray imaging
• Identify four modern medical imaging techniques and how they are used
For thousands of years, fear of the dead and legal sanctions limited the ability of anatomists and physicians to study the
internalstructuresofthehumanbody.Aninabilitytocontrolbleeding,infection,andpainmadesurgeriesinfrequent,and
thosethatwereperformed—suchaswoundsuturing,amputations, toothandtumorremovals,skulldrilling,andcesarean
births—did not greatly advance knowledge about internal anatomy. Theories about the function of the body and about
diseasewerethereforelargelybasedonexternalobservationsandimagination.Duringthefourteenthandfifteenthcenturies,
however,thedetailedanatomicaldrawingsofItalianartistandanatomistLeonardodaVinciandFlemishanatomistAndreas
Vesaliuswerepublished,andinterestinhumananatomybegantoincrease.Medicalschoolsbegantoteachanatomyusing
human dissection; although some resorted to grave robbing to obtain corpses. Laws were eventually passed that enabled
studentstodissectthecorpsesofcriminalsandthosewhodonatedtheirbodiesforresearch.Still,itwasnotuntilthelate
nineteenth century that medical researchers discovered non-surgical methods to look inside the living body.
X-Rays
German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen (1845–1923) was experimenting with electrical current when he discovered that a
mysteriousandinvisible“ray”wouldpassthroughhisfleshbutleaveanoutlineofhisbonesonascreencoatedwithametal
compound.In1895,Röntgenmadethefirstdurablerecordoftheinternalpartsofalivinghuman:an“X-ray”image(asit
cametobecalled)ofhiswife’shand.ScientistsaroundtheworldquicklybegantheirownexperimentswithX-rays,andby
1900,X-rayswerewidelyusedtodetectavarietyofinjuriesanddiseases.In1901,RöntgenwasawardedthefirstNobel
Prize for physics for his work in this field.
The X-ray is a form of high energy electromagnetic radiation with a short wavelength capable of penetrating solids and
ionizing gases. As they are used in medicine, X-rays are emitted from an X-ray machine and directed toward a specially
treatedmetallicplateplacedbehindthepatient’sbody.ThebeamofradiationresultsindarkeningoftheX-rayplate.X-rays

and bones (Figure 1.18). Like many forms of high energy radiation, however, X-rays are capable of damaging cells and

Refinements and enhancements of X-ray techniques have continued throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.
Althoughoftensupplantedbymoresophisticatedimagingtechniques,theX-rayremainsa“workhorse”inmedicalimaging,
especially for viewing fractures and for dentistry. The disadvantage of irradiation to the patient and the operator is now
attenuated by proper shielding and by limiting exposure.
Modern Medical Imaging
X-rayscandepictatwo-dimensionalimageofabodyregion,andonlyfromasingleangle.Incontrast,morerecentmedical
imaging technologies produce data that is integrated and analyzed by computers to produce three-dimensional images or
images that reveal aspects of body functioning.
Computed Tomography
Tomography refers to imaging by sections. Computed tomography (CT) is a noninvasive imaging technique that uses
computerstoanalyzeseveralcross-sectionalX-raysinordertorevealminutedetailsaboutstructuresinthebody(Figure

scanner use?
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive medical imaging technique based on a phenomenon of nuclear
physics discovered in the 1930s, in which matter exposed to magnetic fields and radio waves was found to emit radio
signals. In 1970, a physician and researcher named Raymond Damadian noticed that malignant (cancerous) tissue gave
offdifferentsignalsthannormalbodytissue.HeappliedforapatentforthefirstMRIscanningdevice,whichwasinuse
clinically by the early 1980s. The early MRI scanners were crude, but advances in digital computing and electronics led
totheiradvancementoveranyothertechniqueforpreciseimaging,especiallytodiscovertumors.MRIalsohasthemajor
advantage of not exposing patients to radiation.
Drawbacks of MRI scans include their much higher cost, and patient discomfort with the procedure. The MRI scanner

Positron Emission Tomography
Positronemissiontomography(PET)isamedicalimagingtechniqueinvolvingtheuseofso-calledradiopharmaceuticals,
substances that emit radiation that is short-lived and therefore relatively safe to administer to the body. Although the
first PET scanner was introduced in 1961, it took 15 more years before radiopharmaceuticals were combined with the
technique and revolutionized its potential. The main advantage is that PET (see Figure 1.19c) can illustrate physiologic
activity—includingnutrientmetabolismandbloodflow—oftheorganororgansbeingtargeted,whereasCTandMRIscans

PET relies on radioactive substances administered several minutes before the scan. Watch this video

Ultrasonography
Ultrasonography is an imaging technique that uses the transmission of high-frequency sound waves into the body to
generate an echo signal that is converted by a computer into a real-time image of anatomy and physiology (see Figure
1.19d). Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all imaging techniques, and it is therefore used more freely in sensitive
situationssuchaspregnancy.Thetechnologywasfirstdevelopedinthe1940sand1950s.Ultrasonographyisusedtostudy

metabolism, including energy transfer via anabolic and catabolic reactions; responsiveness; movement; and growth,
differentiation, reproduction, and renewal.
1.4Requirements for Human Life
Humans cannot survive for more than a few minutes without oxygen, for more than several days without water, and for

42 CHAPTER 2 | THE CHEMICAL LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION
• Compare and contrast the four important classes of organic (carbon-based) compounds—proteins,
carbohydrates,lipidsandnucleicacids—accordingtotheircompositionandfunctionalimportancetohuman
life
The smallest, most fundamental material components of the human body are basic chemical elements. In fact, chemicals
callednucleotidebasesarethefoundationofthegeneticcodewiththeinstructionsonhowtobuildandmaintainthehuman
body from conception through old age. There are about three billion of these base pairs in human DNA.
Human chemistry includes organic molecules (carbon-based) and biochemicals (those produced by the body). Human
chemistryalsoincludeselements. Infact,lifecannotexistwithoutmanyoftheelements thatarepartoftheearth.Allof
the elements that contribute to chemical reactions, to the transformation of energy, and to electrical activity and muscle
contraction—elements that include phosphorus, carbon, sodium, and calcium, to name a few—originated in stars.
These elements, in turn, can form both the inorganic and organic chemical compounds important to life, including, for
example, water, glucose, and proteins. This chapter begins by examining elements and how the structures of atoms, the
basic units of matter, determine the characteristics of elements by the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in the
atoms. The chapter then builds the framework of life from there.
2.1 | Elements and Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss the relationships between matter, mass, elements, compounds, atoms, and subatomic particles
• Distinguish between atomic number and mass number
• Identify the key distinction between isotopes of the same element
• Explain how electrons occupy electron shells and their contribution to an atom’s relative stability

erratically in a so-called electron cloud.

Hydrogen has three common isotopes, shown inFigure 2.5.
Figure 2.5 Isotopes of Hydrogen Protium, designated 1H, has one proton and no neutrons. It is by far the
most abundant isotope of hydrogen in nature. Deuterium, designated 2H, has one proton and one neutron. Tritium,
designated3H, has two neutrons.
An isotope that contains more than the usual number of neutrons is referred to as a heavy isotope. An example is 14C.
Heavy isotopes tend to be unstable, and unstable isotopes are radioactive. A radioactive isotope is an isotope whose

Interventional Radiologist
The controlled use of radioisotopes has advanced medical diagnosis and treatment of disease. Interventional
radiologists are physicians who treat disease by using minimally invasive techniques involving radiation. Many

with a fine needle, threaded through one of the patient’s blood vessels. The radiologist then inserts tiny radioactive
“seeds” into the blood vessels that supply the tumors. In the days and weeks following the procedure, the radiation
emitted from the seeds destroys the vessels and directly kills the tumor cells in the vicinity of the treatment.
Radioisotopes emit subatomic particles that can be detected and tracked by imaging technologies. One of the most
advanced uses of radioisotopes in medicine is the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, which detects the
activity in the body of a very small injection of radioactive glucose, the simple sugar that cells use for energy. The

characteristic of cancerous tissue. This PET scan shows sites of the spread of a large primary tumor to other

The Behavior of Electrons
In the human body, atoms do not exist as independent entities. Rather, they are constantly reacting with other atoms to
formandtobreakdownmorecomplexsubstances.Tofullyunderstandanatomyandphysiologyyoumustgrasphowatoms
participate in such reactions. The key is understanding the behavior of electrons.

Polar Covalent Bonds
Groups of legislators with completely opposite views on a particular issue are often described as “polarized” by news
writers. In chemistry, a polar molecule is a molecule that contains regions that have opposite electrical charges. Polar
molecules occur when atoms share electrons unequally, in polar covalent bonds.
Themostfamiliarexampleofapolarmoleculeiswater(Figure2.10).Themoleculehasthreeparts:oneatomofoxygen,

What is true for the bonds is true for the water molecule as a whole; that is, the oxygen region has a slightly negative
chargeandtheregionsofthehydrogenatomshaveaslightlypositivecharge.Thesechargesareoftenreferredtoas“partial
charges” because the strength of the charge is less than one full electron, as would occur in an ionic bond. As shown in

of other polar molecules. For human physiology, the resulting bond is one of the most important formed by water—the
hydrogen bond.
Hydrogen Bonds
A hydrogen bond is formed when a weakly positive hydrogen atom already bonded to one electronegative atom (for
example, the oxygen in the water molecule) is attracted to another electronegative atom from another molecule. In other
words, hydrogen bonds always include hydrogen that is already part of a polar molecule.

2.3 | Chemical Reactions
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Distinguish between kinetic and potential energy, and between exergonic and endergonic chemical reactions
• Identify four forms of energy important in human functioning
• Describe the three basic types of chemical reactions
• Identify several factors influencing the rate of chemical reactions
One characteristic of a living organism is metabolism, which is the sum total of all of the chemical reactions that go
on to maintain that organism’s health and life. The bonding processes you have learned thus far are anabolic chemical
reactions;thatis,theyformlargermoleculesfromsmallermoleculesoratoms.Butrecallthatmetabolismcanproceedin
anotherdirection:incatabolicchemicalreactions,bondsbetweencomponentsoflargermoleculesbreak,releasingsmaller
molecules or atoms. Both types of reaction involve exchanges not only of matter, but of energy.
The Role of Energy in Chemical Reactions
Chemical reactions require a sufficient amount of energy to cause the matter to collide with enough precision and force
that old chemical bonds can be broken and new ones formed. In general, kinetic energy is the form of energy powering
any type of matter in motion. Imagine you are building a brick wall. The energy it takes to lift and place one brick atop
anotheriskineticenergy—theenergymatterpossessesbecauseofitsmotion.Oncethewallisinplace,itstorespotential

where does the energy needed for endergonic reactions come from? In many cases, it comes from exergonic reactions.

Characteristics of Chemical Reactions
Allchemicalreactionsbeginwithareactant,thegeneraltermfortheoneormoresubstancesthatenterintothereaction.
Sodium and chloride ions, for example, are the reactants in the production of table salt. The one or more substances
produced by a chemical reaction are called theproduct.
Inchemicalreactions,thecomponentsofthereactants—theelementsinvolvedandthenumberofatomsofeach—areall
present in the product(s). Similarly, there is nothing present in the products that are not present in the reactants. This is
becausechemicalreactionsaregovernedbythelawofconservationofmass,whichstatesthatmattercannotbecreatedor
destroyed in a chemical reaction.
Just as you can express mathematical calculations in equations such as 2 + 7 = 9, you can use chemical equations
to show how reactants become products. As in math, chemical equations proceed from left to right, but instead of
an equal sign, they employ an arrow or arrows indicating the direction in which the chemical reaction proceeds. For
example, the chemical reaction in which one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen produce ammonia would
be written as N + 3H→NH . Correspondingly, the breakdown of ammonia into its components would be written as
3
NH →N + 3H.

If chemical reactions are to occur quickly, the atoms in the reactants have to have easy access to one another. Thus, the
greaterthesurfaceareaofthereactants,themorereadilytheywillinteract.Whenyoupopacubeofcheeseintoyourmouth,

In addition, recall that some elements are more reactive than others. Reactions that involve highly reactive elements like

temperature, the faster the particles move, and the more likely they are to come in contact and react.

You can think of a catalyst as a chemical change agent. They help increase the rate and force at which atoms, ions, and
molecules collide, thereby increasing the probability that their valence shell electrons will interact.

Enzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its
conversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.
2.4 | Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human
Functioning
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Compare and contrast inorganic and organic compounds
• Identify the properties of water that make it essential to life
• Explain the role of salts in body functioning
• Distinguish between acids and bases, and explain their role in pH
• Discuss the role of buffers in helping the body maintain pH homeostasis
Theconceptsyouhavelearnedsofarinthischaptergovernallformsofmatter,andwouldworkasafoundationforgeology
as well as biology. This section of the chapter narrows the focus to the chemistry of human life; that is, the compounds
important for the body’s structure and function. In general, these compounds are either inorganic or organic.
• An inorganic compound is a substance that does not contain both carbon and hydrogen. A great many inorganic
compounds do contain hydrogen atoms, such as water (H2O) and the hydrochloric acid (HCl) produced by your
stomach.Incontrast,onlyahandfulofinorganiccompoundscontaincarbonatoms.Carbondioxide(CO2)isoneof
the few examples.
• An organic compound, then, is a substance that contains both carbon and hydrogen. Organic compounds are
synthesizedviacovalentbondswithinlivingorganisms,includingthehumanbody.Recallthatcarbonandhydrogen
are the second and third most abundant elements in your body. You will soon discover how these two elements
combineinthefoodsyoueat,inthecompoundsthatmakeupyourbodystructure,andinthechemicalsthatfuelyour
functioning.
The following section examines the three groups of inorganic compounds essential to life: water, salts, acids, and bases.
Organic compounds are covered later in the chapter.
Water
As much as 70 percent of an adult’s body weight is water. This water is contained both within the cells and between the
cells that make up tissues and organs. Its several roles make water indispensable to human functioning.
Water as a Lubricant and Cushion
Water is a major component of many of the body’s lubricating fluids. Just as oil lubricates the hinge on a door, water
in synovial fluid lubricates the actions of body joints, and water in pleural fluid helps the lungs expand and recoil with
58 CHAPTER 2 | THE CHEMICAL LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION
breathing. Watery fluids help keep food flowing through the digestive tract, and ensure that the movement of adjacent
abdominal organs is friction free.
Wateralsoprotectscellsandorgansfromphysicaltrauma,cushioningthebrainwithintheskull,forexample,andprotecting
the delicate nerve tissue of the eyes. Water cushions a developing fetus in the mother’s womb as well.
Water as a Heat Sink
A heat sink is a substance or object that absorbs and dissipates heat but does not experience a corresponding increase in
temperature.Inthebody,waterabsorbstheheatgeneratedbychemicalreactionswithoutgreatlyincreasingintemperature.

away heat, and then the cooler blood from the periphery circulates back to the body core.
Water as a Component of Liquid Mixtures
A mixture is a combination of two or more substances, each of which maintains its own chemical identity. In other
words, the constituent substances are not chemically bonded into a new, larger chemical compound. The concept is easy
to imagine if you think of powdery substances such as flour and sugar; when you stir them together in a bowl, they
obviouslydonotbondtoformanewcompound.Theroomairyoubreatheisagaseousmixture,containingthreediscrete
elements—nitrogen,oxygen,andargon—andonecompound,carbondioxide.Therearethreetypesofliquidmixtures,all
of which contain water as a key component. These are solutions, colloids, and suspensions.
For cells in the body to survive, they must be kept moist in a water-based liquid called a solution. In chemistry, a liquid
solutionconsistsofasolventthatdissolvesasubstancecalledasolute.Animportantcharacteristicofsolutionsisthatthey
arehomogeneous;thatis,thesolutemoleculesaredistributedevenlythroughoutthesolution.Ifyouweretostirateaspoon
of sugar into a glass of water, the sugar would dissolve into sugar molecules separated by water molecules. The ratio of
sugar to water in the left side of the glass would be the same as the ratio of sugar to water in the right side of the glass.
If you were to add more sugar, the ratio of sugar to water would change, but the distribution—provided you had stirred
well—would still be even.
Waterisconsideredthe“universalsolvent”anditisbelievedthatlifecannotexistwithoutwaterbecauseofthis.Wateris
certainlythemostabundantsolventinthebody;essentiallyallofthebody’schemicalreactionsoccuramongcompounds
dissolved in water. Because water molecules are polar, with regions of positive and negative electrical charge, water
readily dissolves ionic compounds and polar covalent compounds. Such compounds are referred to as hydrophilic, or
“water-loving.” As mentioned above, sugar dissolves well in water. This is because sugar molecules contain regions of
hydrogen-oxygenpolarbonds,makingithydrophilic.Nonpolarmolecules,whichdonotreadilydissolveinwater,arecalled
hydrophobic, or “water-fearing.”
Concentrations of Solutes
Various mixtures of solutes and water are described in chemistry. The concentration of a given solute is the number of
particles of that solute in a given space (oxygen makes up about 21 percent of atmospheric air). In the bloodstream of
humans, glucose concentration is usually measured in milligram (mg) per deciliter (dL), and in a healthy adult averages
about100mg/dL.Anothermethodofmeasuringtheconcentrationofasoluteisbyitsmolarilty—whichismoles(M)ofthe

enough to make the liquid mixture opaque (because the particles are large enough to scatter light). Familiar examples of
colloids are milk and cream. In the thyroid glands, the thyroid hormone is stored as a thick protein mixture also called a

normally happen in the healthy body, but aspects of certain diseases can cause blood cells to clump together, and these
heavy clumps of blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube more quickly than do normal blood cells.
The Role of Water in Chemical Reactions
Two types of chemical reactions involve the creation or the consumption of water: dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis.

All cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body
therefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and the
internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and its

or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe diarrhea,
too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with poorly
managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of body fuel.
Thesecanbuildupintheblood,causingaseriousconditioncalleddiabeticketoacidosis.Kidneyfailure,liverfailure,
heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.
Incontrast,alkalosisisaconditioninwhichthebloodandotherbodyfluidsaretooalkaline(basic).Aswithacidosis,
respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low. Lung
disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the normal
concentration of H+.

2.5 | Organic Compounds Essential to Human
Functioning
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify four types of organic molecules essential to human functioning
• Explain the chemistry behind carbon’s affinity for covalently bonding in organic compounds
• Provide examples of three types of carbohydrates, and identify the primary functions of carbohydrates in the body
• Discuss four types of lipids important in human functioning
• Describe the structure of proteins, and discuss their importance to human functioning
• Identify the building blocks of nucleic acids, and the roles of DNA, RNA, and ATP in human functioning
Organic compounds typically consist of groups of carbon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen, usually oxygen, and
oftenotherelementsaswell.Createdbylivingthings,theyarefoundthroughouttheworld,insoilsandseas,commercial
products, and every cell of the human body. The four types most important to human structure and function are
carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleotides. Before exploring these compounds, you need to first understand the
chemistry of carbon.
The Chemistry of Carbon
What makes organic compounds ubiquitous is the chemistry of their carbon core. Recall that carbon atoms have four
electrons in their valence shell, and that the octet rule dictates that atoms tend to react in such a way as to complete
theirvalenceshellwitheightelectrons.Carbonatomsdonotcompletetheirvalenceshellsbydonatingoracceptingfour
electrons. Instead, they readily share electrons via covalent bonds.

Hydroxyl groups are polar. They are components of all four types of organic

synthesis and hydrolysis reactions.
Carboxyl groups are found within fatty acids, amino acids, and many other
Carboxyl O—C—OH
acids.
Amino —N—H2 Amino groups are found within amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.
Methyl —C—H3 Methyl groups are found within amino acids.

Carbohydrates are referred to as saccharides, a word meaning “sugars.” Three forms are important in the body.
Monosaccharides are the monomers of carbohydrates. Disaccharides (di- = “two”) are made up of two monomers.

A disaccharide is a pair of monosaccharides. Disaccharides are formed via dehydration synthesis, and the bond linking
them isreferred toasaglycosidic bond(glyco-=“sugar”). Three disaccharides (showninFigure2.19)areimportant to

Functions of Carbohydrates
Thebodyobtainscarbohydratesfromplant-basedfoods.Grains,fruits,andlegumesandothervegetablesprovidemostof
the carbohydrate in the human diet, although lactose is found in dairy products.
Although most body cells can break down other organic compounds for fuel, all body cells can use glucose. Moreover,
nervecells(neurons)inthebrain,spinalcord,andthroughtheperipheralnervoussystem,aswellasredbloodcells,canuse
onlyglucoseforfuel.Inthebreakdownofglucoseforenergy,moleculesofadenosinetriphosphate,betterknownasATP,
areproduced.Adenosinetriphosphate(ATP)iscomposedofaribosesugar,anadeninebase,andthreephosphategroups.
ATP releases free energy when its phosphate bonds are broken, and thus supplies ready energy to the cell. More ATP is
producedinthepresenceofoxygen(O2)thaninpathwaysthatdonotuseoxygen.Theoverallreactionfortheconversion
of the energy in glucose to energy stored in ATP can be written:

some carbohydrate molecules bind with proteins to produce glycoproteins, and others combine with lipids to produce
glycolipids, both of which are found in the membrane that encloses the contents of body cells.

Triglycerides
Atriglycerideisoneofthemostcommondietarylipidgroups,andthetypefoundmostabundantlyinbodytissues.This
compound, which is commonly referred to as a fat, is formed from the synthesis of two types of molecules (Figure 2.21):
• A glycerol backbone at the core of triglycerides, consists of three carbon atoms.
• Threefattyacids,longchainsofhydrocarbonswithacarboxylgroupandamethylgroupatoppositeends,extendfrom
each of the carbons of the glycerol.
Figure 2.21 Triglycerides Triglycerides are composed of glycerol attached to three fatty acids via dehydration
synthesis. Notice that glycerol gives up a hydrogen atom, and the carboxyl groups on the fatty acids each give up a
hydroxyl group.
Triglycerides form via dehydration synthesis. Glycerol gives up hydrogen atoms from its hydroxyl groups at each bond,
and the carboxyl group on each fatty acid chain gives up a hydroxyl group. A total of three water molecules are thereby
released.

are compounds in which the hydrophobic triglycerides are packaged in protein envelopes for transport in body fluids.
Phospholipids
Asits name suggests, a phospholipid is a bondbetween the glycerol component ofa lipid and a phosphorousmolecule.
Infact,phospholipidsaresimilarinstructuretotriglycerides.However,insteadofhavingthreefattyacids,aphospholipid

theproductionofcertainprostaglandinsthathelpregulateaspectsofbloodpressureandinflammation,andtherebyreduce
the risk for heart disease. Prostaglandins also sensitize nerves to pain. One class of pain-relieving medications called
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) works by reducing the effects of prostaglandins.

Proteins
You might associate proteins with muscle tissue, but in fact, proteins are critical components of all tissues and organs.
A protein is an organic molecule composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Proteins include the keratin in the
epidermisofskinthatprotectsunderlyingtissues,thecollagenfoundinthedermisofskin,inbones,andinthemeninges
thatcoverthebrainandspinalcord.Proteinsarealsocomponentsofmanyofthebody’sfunctional chemicals, including
digestiveenzymesinthedigestivetract,antibodies,theneurotransmittersthatneuronsusetocommunicatewithothercells,
andthepeptide-basedhormonesthatregulatecertainbodyfunctions(forinstance,growthhormone).Whilecarbohydrates
andlipidsarecomposedofhydrocarbonsandoxygen,allproteinsalsocontainnitrogen(N),andmanycontainsulfur(S),
in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
Microstructure of Proteins
Proteins are polymers made up of nitrogen-containing monomers called amino acids. An amino acid is a molecule
composed of an amino group and a carboxyl group, together with a variable side chain. Just 20 different amino acids
contribute to nearly all of the thousands of different proteins important in human structure and function. Body proteins
containauniquecombinationofafewdozentoafewhundredofthese20aminoacidmonomers.All20oftheseamino
acids share a similar structure (Figure 2.24). All consist of a central carbon atom to which the following are bonded:
• a hydrogen atom
• an alkaline (basic) amino group NH2(seeTable 2.1)
• an acidic carboxyl group COOH (seeTable 2.1)
• a variable group
Figure 2.24Structure of an Amino Acid
Notice that all amino acids contain both an acid (the carboxyl group) and a base (the amino group) (amine = “nitrogen-
containing”).Forthisreason,theymakeexcellentbuffers,helpingthebodyregulateacid–basebalance.Whatdistinguishes
the20aminoacidsfromoneanotheristheirvariablegroup,whichisreferredtoasasidechainoranR-group.Thisgroup
can vary in size and can be polar or nonpolar, giving each amino acid its unique characteristics. For example, the side
chainsoftwoaminoacids—cysteineandmethionine—containsulfur.Sulfurdoesnotreadilyparticipateinhydrogenbonds,
whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way that proteins containing cysteine and methionine are
assembled.

72 CHAPTER 2 | THE CHEMICAL LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION
Figure 2.25 Peptide Bond Different amino acids join together to form peptides, polypeptides, or proteins via
dehydration synthesis. The bonds between the amino acids are peptide bonds.
The body is able to synthesize most of the amino acids from components of other molecules; however, nine cannot be
synthesized and have to be consumed in the diet. These are known as the essential amino acids.
Freeaminoacidsavailableforproteinconstructionaresaidtoresideintheaminoacidpoolwithincells.Structureswithin
cells use these amino acids when assembling proteins. If a particular essential amino acid is not available in sufficient
quantities in the amino acid pool, however, synthesis of proteins containing it can slow or even cease.
Shape of Proteins
Just as a fork cannot be used to eat soup and a spoon cannot be used to spear meat, a protein’s shape is essential to its
function.Aprotein’sshapeisdetermined,mostfundamentally,bythesequenceofaminoacidsofwhichitismade(Figure
2.26a). The sequence is called the primary structure of the protein.

CHAPTER 2 | THE CHEMICAL LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION 73
Figure 2.26 The Shape of Proteins (a) The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids that make up the
polypeptide chain. (b) The secondary structure, which can take the form of an alpha-helix or a beta-pleated sheet,
ismaintainedbyhydrogenbondsbetweenaminoacidsindifferentregionsoftheoriginalpolypeptidestrand.(c)The
tertiary structure occurs as a result of further folding and bonding of the secondary structure. (d) The quaternary
structure occurs as a result of interactions between two or more tertiary subunits. The example shown here is
hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells which transports oxygen to body tissues.
Althoughsomepolypeptidesexistaslinearchains,mostaretwistedorfoldedintomorecomplexsecondarystructuresthat

commonsecondarystructureisaspiralcalledanalpha-helix.Ifyouweretotakealengthofstringandsimplytwistitinto
a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without
the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see Figure 2.26b). Less
commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different
regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains.
Thesecondarystructureofproteinsfurtherfoldsintoacompactthree-dimensionalshape,referredtoastheprotein’stertiary
structure (see Figure 2.26c). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be
brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. A disulfide bond is a
covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even
larger protein with a quaternary structure (see Figure 2.26d). The polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure
can be identical or different. For instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary
polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains.

important for skeletal growth, among other roles.

Nucleotides
The fourth type of organic compound important to human structure and function are the nucleotides (Figure 2.28). A
nucleotideis one of a class of organic compounds composed of three subunits:
• one or more phosphate groups
• a pentose sugar: either deoxyribose or ribose
• a nitrogen-containing base: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, or uracil
Nucleotides can be assembled into nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) or the energy compound adenosine triphosphate.

Removalofasecondphosphateleavesadenosinemonophosphate(AMP)andtwophosphategroups.Again,thesereactions
also liberate the energy that had been stored in the phosphate-phosphate bonds. They are reversible, too, as when ADP
undergoes phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate group to an organic compound, in this case,
resulting in ATP. In such cases, the same level of energy that had been released during hydrolysis must be reinvested to
power dehydration synthesis.
CellscanalsotransferaphosphategroupfromATPtoanotherorganiccompound.Forexample,whenglucosefirstenters
a cell, a phosphate group is transferred from ATP, forming glucose phosphate (C6H12O6—P) and ADP. Once glucose is
phosphorylated in this way, it can be stored as glycogen or metabolized for immediate energy.

Each moment of life, atoms of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and the other elements of the human body are making and
breakingchemicalbonds.Ionsarechargedatomsthatformwhenanatomdonatesoracceptsoneormorenegativelycharged
electrons.Cations(ionswithapositivecharge)areattractedtoanions(ionswithanegativecharge).Thisattractioniscalled
an ionic bond. In covalent bonds, the participating atoms do not lose or gain electrons, but rather share them. Molecules
with nonpolar covalent bonds are electrically balanced, and have a linear three-dimensional shape. Molecules with polar
covalent bonds have “poles”—regions of weakly positive and negative charge—and have a triangular three-dimensional
shape.Anatomofoxygenandtwoatomsofhydrogenformwatermoleculesbymeansofpolarcovalentbonds.Hydrogen

2.5Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning
Organic compounds essential to human functioning include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleotides. These
compounds are said to be organic because they contain both carbon and hydrogen. Carbon atoms in organic compounds
readily share electrons with hydrogenandotheratoms, usually oxygen,andsometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also may
bondwithoneormorefunctionalgroupssuchascarboxyls,hydroxyls,aminos,orphosphates.Monomersaresingleunits
of organic compounds. They bond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which can in turn be broken by hydrolysis.
Carbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel. Their structural forms include monosaccharides such as glucose,
disaccharidessuchaslactose,andpolysaccharides,includingstarches(polymersofglucose),glycogen(thestorageformof
glucose), and fiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel. It is converted via an oxidation-reduction reaction to ATP.

membrane)separatestheinnercontentsofacellfromitsexteriorenvironment.Thiscellmembraneprovidesaprotective
barrier around the cell and regulates which materials can pass in or out.
Structure and Composition of the Cell Membrane
The cell membrane is an extremely pliable structure composed primarily of back-to-back phospholipids (a “bilayer”).
Cholesterol is also present, which contributes to the fluidity of the membrane, and there are various proteins embedded
within the membrane that have a variety of functions.
Asinglephospholipidmoleculehasaphosphategroupononeend,calledthe“head,”andtwoside-by-sidechainsoffatty
acids that make up the lipid tails (Figure 3.2). The phosphate group is negatively charged, making the head polar and
hydrophilic—or “water loving.” A hydrophilic molecule (or region of a molecule) is one that is attracted to water. The
phosphateheadsarethusattractedtothewatermoleculesofboththeextracellularandintracellularenvironments.Thelipid
tails, on the other hand, are uncharged, or nonpolar, and are hydrophobic—or “water fearing.” A hydrophobic molecule

Passive Transport

gradients and diffusion. A concentration gradient is the difference in concentration of a substance across a space.
Molecules(orions)willspread/diffusefromwheretheyaremoreconcentratedtowheretheyarelessconcentrateduntilthey
are equally distributed in that space. (When molecules move in this way, they are said to move down their concentration
gradient.)Diffusionisthemovementofparticlesfromanareaofhigherconcentrationtoanareaoflowerconcentration.

aids in diffusion of particles within the body.
Visitthislink(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/diffusion)toseediffusionandhowitispropelledbythekineticenergy
of molecules in solution. How does temperature affect diffusion rate, and why?
Whenever a substance exists in greater concentration on one side of a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell
membranes, any substance that can move down its concentration gradient across the membrane will do so. Consider
substancesthatcaneasilydiffusethroughthelipidbilayerofthecellmembrane,suchasthegasesoxygen(O2)andCO2.O2
generallydiffusesintocellsbecauseitismoreconcentratedoutsideofthem,andCO2typicallydiffusesoutofcellsbecause
itismoreconcentratedinsideofthem.Neitheroftheseexamplesrequiresanyenergyonthepartofthecell,andtherefore
they use passive transport to move across the membrane.
Before moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use up
oxygenduringmetabolism,thereistypicallyalowerconcentrationofO2insidethecellthanoutside.Asaresult,oxygen
will diffuse from the interstitial fluid directly through the lipid bilayer of the membrane and into the cytoplasm within
the cell. On the other hand, because cells produce CO2 as a byproduct of metabolism, CO2 concentrations rise within
the cytoplasm; therefore, CO2 will move from the cell through the lipid bilayer and into the interstitial fluid, where its
concentrationislower.Thismechanismofmoleculesspreadingfromwheretheyaremoreconcentratedtowheretheyare
less concentration is a form of passive transport called simple diffusion (Figure 3.5).
Figure 3.5 Simple Diffusion across the Cell (Plasma) Membrane The structure of the lipid bilayer allows only
small, non-polar substances such as oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass through the cell membrane, down their
concentration gradient, by simple diffusion.

As an example, even though sodium ions (Na+) are highly concentrated outside of cells, these electrolytes are polarized
and cannot pass through the nonpolar lipid bilayer of the membrane. Their diffusion is facilitated by membrane proteins

Active Transport
For all of the transport methods described above, the cell expends no energy. Membrane proteins that aid in the passive
transportofsubstancesdosowithouttheuseofATP.Duringactivetransport,ATPisrequiredtomoveasubstanceacrossa
membrane, often with the help of protein carriers, and usuallyagainstits concentration gradient.
One of the most common types of active transport involves proteins that serve as pumps. The word “pump” probably
conjures up thoughts of using energy to pump up the tire of a bicycle or a basketball. Similarly, energy from ATP is
required for these membrane proteins to transport substances—molecules or ions—across the membrane, usually against
their concentration gradients (from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration).

The sodium-potassium pump, which is also called Na+/K+ ATPase, transports sodium out of a cell while moving

Figure 3.9 Sodium-Potassium Pump The sodium-potassium pump is found in many cell (plasma) membranes.
Powered by ATP, the pump moves sodium and potassium ions in opposite directions, each against its concentration
gradient.Inasinglecycleofthepump,threesodiumionsareextrudedfromandtwopotassiumionsareimportedinto

Active transport pumps can also work together with other active or passive transport systems to move substances across

the sodium ions will drive them to diffuse into the cell. In this way, the action of an active transport pump (the sodium-
potassiumpump)powersthepassivetransportofsodiumionsbycreatingaconcentrationgradient.Whenactivetransport
powers the transport of another substance in this way, it is called secondary active transport.
Symporters are secondary active transporters that move two substances in the same direction. For example, the sodium-
glucose symporter uses sodium ions to “pull” glucose molecules into the cell. Because cells store glucose for energy,
glucose is typically at a higher concentration inside of the cell than outside. However, due to the action of the sodium-
potassium pump, sodium ions will easily diffuse into the cell when the symporter is opened. The flood of sodium ions

patrol body tissues for unwanted matter, such as invading bacterial cells, phagocytize them, and digest them. In contrast
to phagocytosis, pinocytosis (“cell drinking”) brings fluid containing dissolved substances into a cell through membrane
vesicles.

Phagocytosis and pinocytosis take in large portions of extracellular material, and they are typically not highly selective
in the substances they bring in. Cells regulate the endocytosis of specific substances via receptor-mediated endocytosis.
Receptor-mediated endocytosis is endocytosis by a portion of the cell membrane that contains many receptors that are
specific for a certain substance. Once the surface receptors have bound sufficient amounts of the specific substance (the
receptor’sligand), thecell will endocytose thepartofthecell membrane containing thereceptor-ligand complexes. Iron,
a required component of hemoglobin, is endocytosed by red blood cells in this way. Iron is bound to a protein called
transferrinintheblood.Specifictransferrinreceptorsonredbloodcellsurfacesbindtheiron-transferrinmolecules,andthe

CHAPTER 3 | THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION 95
Cell: Cystic Fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States, with about 1,000 new cases reported
each year. The genetic disease is most well known for its damage to the lungs, causing breathing difficulties and
chroniclunginfections,butitalsoaffectstheliver,pancreas,andintestines.Onlyabout50yearsago,theprognosis
for children born with CF was very grim—a life expectancy rarely over 10 years. Today, with advances in medical
treatment, many CF patients live into their 30s.
The symptoms of CF result from a malfunctioning membrane ion channel called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductanceregulator,orCFTR.Inhealthypeople,theCFTRproteinisanintegralmembraneproteinthattransports
Cl– ions out of the cell. In a person who has CF, the gene for the CFTR is mutated, thus, the cell manufactures a
defective channel protein that typically is not incorporated into the membrane, but is instead degraded by the cell.
TheCFTRrequiresATPinordertofunction,makingitsCl–transportaformofactivetransport.Thischaracteristic
puzzledresearchersforalongtimebecausetheCl–ionsareactuallyflowingdowntheirconcentrationgradientwhen
transported out of cells. Active transport generally pumps ions against their concentration gradient, but the CFTR
presents an exception to this rule.
In normal lung tissue, the movement of Cl– out of the cell maintains a Cl–-rich, negatively charged environment
immediately outside of the cell. This is particularly important in the epithelial lining of the respiratory system.

If the CFTR channel is absent, Cl– ions are not transported out of the cell in adequate numbers, thus preventing
them from drawing positive ions. The absence of ions in the secreted mucus results in the lack of a normal water

3.2 | The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describethestructureandfunctionofthecellularorganellesassociatedwiththeendomembranesystem,including
the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes
• Describe the structure and function of mitochondria and peroxisomes
• Explain the three components of the cytoskeleton, including their composition and functions
Now that you have learned that the cell membrane surrounds all cells, you can dive inside of a prototypical human cell
to learn about its internal components and their functions. All living cells in multicellular organisms contain an internal
cytoplasmic compartment, andanucleus within the cytoplasm. Cytosol,the jelly-like substance within the cell, provides
the fluid medium necessary for biochemical reactions. Eukaryotic cells, including all animal cells, also contain various
cellular organelles. An organelle (“little organ”) is one of several different types of membrane-enclosed bodies in the
cell, each performing a unique function. Just as the various bodily organs work together in harmony to perform all of a
human’sfunctions,themanydifferentcellular organelles worktogethertokeepthecellhealthyandperformingallofits
important functions. The organelles and cytosol, taken together, compose the cell’s cytoplasm. The nucleus is a cell’s
central organelle, which contains the cell’s DNA (Figure 3.13).

Endoplasmic reticulum can exist in two forms: rough ER and smooth ER. These two types of ER perform some very
different functions and can be found in very different amounts depending on the type of cell. Rough ER (RER) is so-
called because its membrane is dotted with embedded granules—organelles called ribosomes, giving the RER a bumpy
appearance.Aribosomeisanorganellethatservesasthesiteofproteinsynthesis.ItiscomposedoftworibosomalRNA

Humans take in all sorts of toxins from the environment and also produce harmful chemicals as byproducts of cellular
processes. Cells called hepatocytes in the liver detoxify many of these toxins.
Mitochondria
A mitochondrion (plural = mitochondria) is a membranous, bean-shaped organelle that is the “energy transformer” of
the cell. Mitochondria consist of an outer lipid bilayer membrane as well as an additional inner lipid bilayer membrane
(Figure3.16).Theinnermembraneishighlyfoldedintowindingstructureswithagreatdealofsurfacearea,calledcristae.
Itisalongthisinnermembranethataseriesofproteins,enzymes,andothermoleculesperformthebiochemicalreactions
of cellular respiration. These reactions convert energy stored in nutrient molecules (such as glucose) into adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), which provides usable cellular energy to the cell. Cells use ATP constantly, and so the mitochondria
are constantly at work. Oxygen molecules are required during cellular respiration, which is why you must constantly
breathe it in. One of the organ systems in the body that uses huge amounts of ATP is the muscular system because ATP
isrequiredtosustainmusclecontraction.Asaresult,musclecellsarepackedfullofmitochondria.Nervecellsalsoneed
large quantities of ATP to run their sodium-potassium pumps. Therefore, an individual neuron will be loaded with over
a thousand mitochondria. On the other hand, a bone cell, which is not nearly as metabolically-active, might only have a
couple hundred mitochondria.

that they do not wreak havoc in the cells. The liver is the organ primarily responsible for detoxifying the blood before it
travels throughout the body, and liver cells contain an exceptionally high number of peroxisomes.
Defense mechanisms such as detoxification within the peroxisome and certain cellular antioxidants serve to neutralize
manyofthesemolecules.Somevitaminsandothersubstances,foundprimarilyinfruitsandvegetables,haveantioxidant

The free radical theory on aging was originally proposed in the 1950s, and still remains under debate. Generally

It is believed that this increase is at least in part due to a reduction of oxidative stress. However, a long-term study
of primates with calorie-restriction showed no increase in their lifespan. A great deal of additional research will be
required to better understand the link between reactive oxygen species and aging.
The Cytoskeleton
Much like the bony skeleton structurally supports the human body, the cytoskeleton helps the cells to maintain their
structuralintegrity.Thecytoskeletonisagroupoffibrousproteinsthatprovidestructuralsupportforcells,butthisisonly

transportation of substances within the cell.
The cytoskeleton forms a complex thread-like network throughout the cell consisting of three different kinds of protein-
based filaments: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (Figure 3.18). The thickest of the three is the
microtubule,astructuralfilamentcomposedofsubunitsofaproteincalledtubulin.Microtubulesmaintaincellshapeand
structure, help resist compression of the cell, and play a role in positioning the organelles within the cell. Microtubules

Once synthesized, newly made ribosomal subunits exit the cell’s nucleus through the nuclear pores.
The genetic instructions that are used to build and maintain an organism are arranged in an orderly manner in strands of
DNA. Within the nucleus are threads of chromatin composed of DNA and associated proteins (Figure 3.22). Along the
chromatinthreads,theDNAiswrappedaroundasetofhistoneproteins.Anucleosomeisasingle,wrappedDNA-histone

Stage 3: Termination. Once the two original strands are bound to their own, finished, complementary strands, DNA
replication is stopped and the two new identical DNA molecules are complete.
Each new DNA molecule contains one strand from the original molecule and one newly synthesized strand. The term
for this mode of replication is “semiconservative,” because half of the original DNA molecule is conserved in each new
DNA molecule. This process continues until the cell’s entire genome, the entire complement of an organism’s DNA, is

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain how the genetic code stored within DNA determines the protein that will form
• Describe the process of transcription
• Describe the process of translation
• Discuss the function of ribosomes
It was mentioned earlier that DNA provides a “blueprint” for the cell structure and physiology. This refers to the fact
thatDNAcontainstheinformationnecessaryforthecelltobuildoneveryimportanttypeofmolecule:theprotein.Most

up necessary biochemical reactions that take place inside the cell. Some of these critical biochemical reactions include
buildinglargermoleculesfromsmallercomponents(suchasoccursduringDNAreplicationorsynthesisofmicrotubules)
and breaking down larger molecules into smaller components (such as when harvesting chemical energy from nutrient

Figure 3.25 The Genetic Code DNA holds all of the genetic information necessary to build a cell’s proteins. The
nucleotide sequence of a gene is ultimately translated into an amino acid sequence of the gene’s corresponding
protein.

When different coding regions of mRNA are spliced out, different variations of the protein will eventually result, with

When the mRNA transcript is ready, it travels out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm.

within a pre-mRNA transcript and reconnects the exons.
From RNA to Protein: Translation
Like translating a book from one language into another, the codons on a strand of mRNA must be translated into the
amino acid alphabet ofproteins. Translation is the process ofsynthesizing a chain ofamino acids called a polypeptide.
Translation requires two major aids: first, a “translator,” the molecule that will conduct the translation, and second, a
substrateonwhichthemRNAstrandistranslatedintoanewprotein,likethetranslator’s“desk.”Bothoftheserequirements
are fulfilled by other types of RNA. The substrate on which translation takes place is the ribosome.
Rememberthatmanyofacell’sribosomesarefoundassociatedwiththeroughER,andcarryoutthesynthesisofproteins
destined for the Golgi apparatus. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a type of RNA that, together with proteins, composes the
structureoftheribosome.Ribosomesexistinthecytoplasmastwodistinctcomponents,asmallandalargesubunit.When
an mRNA molecule is ready to be translated, the two subunits come together and attach to the mRNA. The ribosome
provides a substrate for translation, bringing together and aligning the mRNA molecule with the molecular “translators”
that must decipher its code.
The other major requirement for protein synthesis is the translator molecules that physically “read” the mRNA codons.
Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a type of RNA that ferries the appropriate corresponding amino acids to the ribosome, and
attacheseachnewaminoacidtothelast,buildingthepolypeptidechainone-by-one.ThustRNAtransfersspecificamino

112 CHAPTER 3 | THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION
Figure 3.29 From DNA to Protein: Transcription through Translation Transcription within the cell nucleus
produces an mRNA molecule, which is modified and then sent into the cytoplasm for translation. The transcript is
decoded into a protein with the help of a ribosome and tRNA molecules.
Commonly, an mRNA transcription will be translated simultaneously by several adjacent ribosomes. This increases the
efficiency of protein synthesis. A single ribosome might translate an mRNA molecule in approximately one minute; so
multiple ribosomes aboard a single transcript could produce multiple times the number of the same protein in the same
minute. Apolyribosomeis a string of ribosomes translating a single mRNA strand.

The Cell Cycle
One “turn” or cycle of the cell cycle consists of two general phases: interphase, followed by mitosis and cytokinesis.
Interphase is the period of the cell cycle during which the cell is not dividing. The majority of cells are in interphase
mostofthetime.Mitosisisthedivisionofgeneticmaterial,duringwhichthecellnucleusbreaksdownandtwonew,fully

that have permanently ceased dividing (like nerve cells) are said to be in G0.
The Structure of Chromosomes

Mitosis and Cytokinesis
The mitotic phase of the cell typically takes between 1 and 2 hours. During this phase, a cell undergoes two major
processes. First, it completes mitosis, during which the contents of the nucleus are equitably pulled apart and distributed
betweenitstwohalves.Cytokinesisthenoccurs,dividingthecytoplasmandcellbodyintotwonewcells.Mitosisisdivided
into four major stages that take place after interphase (Figure 3.32) and in the following order: prophase, metaphase,
anaphase, and telophase. The process is then followed by cytokinesis.
Figure 3.32 Cell Division: Mitosis Followed by Cytokinesis The stages of cell division oversee the separation of
identical genetic material into two new nuclei, followed by the division of the cytoplasm.

chromosomes.Duringprophase,eachchromosomebecomesvisiblewithitsidenticalpartnerattached,formingthefamiliar

A major occurrence during prophase concerns a very important structure that contains the origin site for microtubule
growth. Recall the cellular structures called centrioles that serve as origin points from which microtubules extend. These
tinystructuresalsoplayaveryimportantroleduringmitosis.Acentrosomeisapairofcentriolestogether.Thecellcontains
two centrosomes side-by-side, which begin to move apart during prophase. As the centrosomes migrate to two different
sidesofthecell,microtubulesbegintoextendfromeachlikelongfingersfromtwohandsextendingtowardeachother.The
mitotic spindleis the structure composed of the centrosomes and their emerging microtubules.
Near the end of prophase there is an invasion of the nuclear area by microtubules from the mitotic spindle. The nuclear
membrane has disintegrated, and the microtubules attach themselves to the centromeres that adjoin pairs of sister
chromatids. The kinetochore is a protein structure on the centromere that is the point of attachment between the mitotic
spindle and the sister chromatids. This stage is referred to as late prophase or “prometaphase” to indicate the transition
between prophase and metaphase.
Metaphase is the second stage of mitosis. During this stage, the sister chromatids, with their attached microtubules, line

3.6 | Cellular Differentiation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss how the generalized cells of a developing embryo or the stem cells of an adult organism become
differentiated into specialized cells
• Distinguish between the categories of stem cells
How does a complex organism such as a human develop from a single cell—a fertilized egg—into the vast array of
cell types such as nerve cells, muscle cells, and epithelial cells that characterize the adult? Throughout development
and adulthood, the process of cellular differentiation leads cells to assume their final morphology and physiology.
Differentiation is the process by which unspecialized cells become specialized to carry out distinct functions.
Stem Cells
Astemcellisanunspecializedcellthatcandividewithoutlimitasneededandcan,underspecificconditions,differentiate

There are different stem cells present at different stages of a human’s life. They include the embryonic stem cells of the
embryo, fetal stem cells of the fetus, and adult stem cells in the adult. One type of adult stem cell is the epithelial stem
cell, which gives rise to the keratinocytes in the multiple layers of epithelial cells in the epidermis of skin. Adult bone

Cells also contain mitochondria and peroxisomes, which are the organelles responsible for producing the cell’s energy
supply and detoxifying certain chemicals, respectively. Biochemical reactions within mitochondria transform energy-
carrying molecules into the usable form of cellular energy known as ATP. Peroxisomes contain enzymes that transform
harmful substances such as free radicals into oxygen and water. Cells also contain a miniaturized “skeleton” of protein
filaments that extend throughout its interior. Three different kinds of filaments compose this cytoskeleton (in order of
increasing thickness): microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. Each cytoskeletal component performs
unique functions as well as provides a supportive framework for the cell.

lies in the particular sequence of nucleotides that make up each gene along the DNA molecule. To “read” this code, the
cell must perform two sequential steps. In the first step, transcription, the DNA code is converted into a RNA code. A

The Four Types of Tissues
Epithelialtissue,alsoreferredtoasepithelium,referstothesheetsofcellsthatcoverexteriorsurfacesofthebody,lines
internal cavities and passageways, and forms certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the cells and
organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the body. Muscle
tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as three major types:
skeletal(voluntary)muscle,smoothmuscle,andcardiacmuscleintheheart.Nervoustissueisalsoexcitable,allowingthe
propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate between different regions of the
body (Figure 4.2).
The next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just as

within the embryo. Each of these lineages of embryonic cells forms the distinct germ layers from which all the tissues
and organs of the human body eventually form. Each germ layer is identified by its relative position: ectoderm (ecto-
= “outer”), mesoderm (meso- = “middle”), and endoderm (endo- = “inner”). Figure 4.3 shows the types of tissues and
organsassociatedwiththeeachofthethreegermlayers.Notethatepithelialtissueoriginatesinallthreelayers,whereas

Theconnectivetissuemembraneisformedsolelyfromconnectivetissue.Thesemembranesencapsulateorgans,suchas
the kidneys, and line our movable joints. A synovial membrane is a type of connective tissue membrane that lines the

Many epithelial cells are capable of secretion and release mucous and specific chemical compounds onto their apical
surfaces. The epithelium of the small intestine releases digestive enzymes, for example. Cells lining the respiratory tract
secrete mucous that traps incoming microorganisms and particles. A glandular epithelium contains many secretory cells.

Cell to Cell Junctions
Cells of epithelia are closely connected and are not separated by intracellular material. Three basic types of connections
allowvaryingdegreesofinteractionbetweenthecells:tightjunctions,anchoringjunctions,andgapjunctions(Figure4.5).

At one end of the spectrum is the tight junction, which separates the cells into apical and basal compartments. An
anchoring junction includes several types of cell junctions that help stabilize epithelial tissues. Anchoring junctions are

Theseconnectionsareespeciallyimportantinholdingcellstogether.Hemidesmosomes,whichlooklikehalfadesmosome,
link cells to the extracellular matrix, for example, the basal lamina. While similar in appearance to desmosomes, they
include the adhesion proteins called integrins rather than cadherins. Adherens junctions use either cadherins or integrins
depending on whether they are linking to other cells or matrix. The junctions are characterized by the presence of the
contractileproteinactinlocatedonthecytoplasmicsurfaceofthecellmembrane.Theactincanconnectisolatedpatchesor

In contrast with the tight and anchoring junctions, a gap junction forms an intercellular passageway between the

cells.Thesejunctionsallowelectricalandmetaboliccouplingofadjacentcells,whichcoordinatesfunctioninlargegroups

Ciliated columnar epithelium is composed of simple columnar epithelial cells with cilia on their apical surfaces. These
epithelial cells are found in the lining of the fallopian tubes and parts of the respiratory system, where the beating of the
cilia helps remove particulate matter.

in fact all the cells are in contact with the basal lamina, although some do not reach the apical surface. Pseudostratified
columnar epithelium is found in the respiratory tract, where some of these cells have cilia.
Both simple and pseudostratified columnar epithelia are heterogeneous epithelia because they include additional types
of cells interspersed among the epithelial cells. For example, a goblet cell is a mucous-secreting unicellular “gland”
interspersed between the columnar epithelial cells of mucous membranes (Figure 4.7).

A stratified epithelium consists of several stacked layers of cells. This epithelium protects against physical and chemical
wear andtear.The stratified epithelium isnamed bythe shape ofthe most apical layer ofcells, closest tothe free space.

Glandular Epithelium

consist of groups of epithelial cells. A gland can be classified as an endocrine gland, a ductless gland that releases
secretions directly into surrounding tissues and fluids (endo- = “inside”), or an exocrine gland whose secretions leave
through a duct that opens directly, or indirectly, to the external environment (exo- = “outside”).
Endocrine Glands

Methods and Types of Secretion
Exocrine glands can be classified by their mode of secretion and the nature of the substances released, as well as by
the structure of the glands and shape of ducts (Figure 4.10). Merocrine secretion is the most common type of exocrine
secretion.Thesecretionsareenclosedinvesiclesthatmovetotheapicalsurfaceofthecellwherethecontentsarereleased
by exocytosis. For example, watery mucous containing the glycoprotein mucin, a lubricant that offers some pathogen
protection is a merocrine secretion. The eccrine glands that produce and secrete sweat are another example.

apocrineglandscontinuetoproduceandsecretetheircontentswithlittledamagecausedtothecellbecausethenucleusand
golgi regions remain intact after secretion.
In contrast, the process of holocrine secretion involves the rupture and destruction of the entire gland cell. The cell
accumulates its secretory products and releases them only when it bursts. New gland cells differentiate from cells in the
surrounding tissue to replace those lost by secretion. The sebaceous glands that produce the oils on the skin and hair are
holocrine glands/cells (Figure 4.11).

4.3 | Connective Tissue Supports and Protects
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify and distinguish between the types of connective tissue: proper, supportive, and fluid
• Explain the functions of connective tissues
Asmaybeobviousfromitsname,oneofthemajorfunctionsofconnectivetissueistoconnecttissuesandorgans.Unlike
epithelial tissue, which is composed of cells closely packed with little or no extracellular space in between, connective
tissue cells are dispersed in a matrix. The matrix usually includes a large amount of extracellular material produced by
the connective tissue cells that are embedded within it. The matrix plays a major role in the functioning of this tissue.

Embryonic Connective Tissue
All connective tissues derive from the mesodermal layer of the embryo (see Figure 4.3). The first connective tissue to
develop in the embryo is mesenchyme, the stem cell line from which all connective tissues are later derived. Clusters

of mesenchymal cells are scattered throughout adult tissue and supply the cells needed for replacement and repair after
a connective tissue injury. A second type of embryonic connective tissue forms in the umbilical cord, called mucous

Classification of Connective Tissues
The three broad categories of connective tissue are classified according to the characteristics of their ground substance
and the types of fibers found within the matrix (Table 4.1). Connective tissue proper includes loose connective tissue
and dense connective tissue. Both tissues have a variety of cell types and protein fibers suspended in a viscous ground
substance.Denseconnectivetissueisreinforcedbybundlesoffibersthatprovidetensilestrength,elasticity,andprotection.
In loose connective tissue, the fibers are loosely organized, leaving large spaces in between. Supportive connective

Connective Tissue Proper
Fibroblasts are present in all connective tissue proper (Figure 4.12). Fibrocytes, adipocytes, and mesenchymal cells are
fixed cells, which means they remain within the connective tissue. Other cells move in and out of the connective tissue
in response to chemical signals. Macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and phagocytic cells are found in
connective tissue proper but are actually part of the immune system protecting the body.

The macrophage cell is a large cell derived from a monocyte, a type of blood cell, which enters the connective tissue
matrix from the blood vessels. The macrophage cells are an essential component of the immune system, which is the
body’sdefenseagainstpotentialpathogensanddegradedhostcells.Whenstimulated,macrophagesreleasecytokines,small

Adipose tissue consists mostly of fat storage cells, with little extracellular matrix (Figure 4.13). A large number of
capillaries allow rapid storage and mobilization of lipid molecules. White adipose tissue is most abundant. It can appear

Dense Connective Tissue
Dense connective tissue contains more collagen fibers than does loose connective tissue. As a consequence, it displays
greater resistance to stretching. There are two major categories of dense connective tissue: regular and irregular. Dense
regular connective tissue fibers are parallel to each other, enhancing tensile strength and resistance to stretching in the
directionofthefiberorientations.Ligamentsandtendonsaremadeofdenseregularconnectivetissue,butinligamentsnot
all fibers are parallel. Dense regular elastic tissue contains elastin fibers in addition to collagen fibers, which allows the
ligamenttoreturntoitsoriginallengthafterstretching.Theligamentsinthevocalfoldsandbetweenthevertebraeinthe
vertebral column are elastic.
In dense irregular connective tissue, the direction of fibers is random. This arrangement gives the tissue greater strength
in all directions and less strength in one particular direction. In some tissues, fibers crisscross and form a mesh. In other
tissues, stretching in several directions is achieved by alternating layers where fibers run in the same orientation in each
layer,anditisthelayersthemselvesthatarestackedatanangle.Thedermisoftheskinisanexampleofdenseirregular

Supportive Connective Tissues
Two major forms of supportive connective tissue, cartilage and bone, allow the body to maintain its posture and protect
internal organs.
Cartilage
The distinctive appearance of cartilage is due to polysaccharides called chondroitin sulfates, which bind with ground
substance proteins to form proteoglycans. Embedded within the cartilage matrix are chondrocytes, or cartilage cells,
and the space they occupy are called lacunae (singular = lacuna). A layer of dense irregular connective tissue, the
152 CHAPTER 4 | THE TISSUE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION
perichondrium, encapsulates the cartilage. Cartilaginous tissue is avascular, thus all nutrients need to diffuse through the
matrix to reach the chondrocytes. This is a factor contributing to the very slow healing of cartilaginous tissues.
The three main types of cartilage tissue are hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and elastic cartilage (Figure 4.16). Hyaline

Bone
Bone is the hardest connective tissue. It provides protection to internal organs and supports the body. Bone’s rigid
extracellular matrix contains mostly collagen fibers embedded in a mineralized ground substance containing
hydroxyapatite, a form of calcium phosphate. Both components of the matrix, organic and inorganic, contribute to the
unusual properties of bone. Without collagen, bones would be brittle and shatter easily. Without mineral crystals, bones

molecules and excess fluid from interstitial spaces to enter the lymphatic vessels. Lymph drains into blood vessels,

Neurons propagate information via electrochemical impulses, called action potentials, which are biochemically linked to
the release of chemical signals. Neuroglia play an essential role in supporting neurons and modulating their information
propagation.

extensions. A long “tail,” the axon, extends from the neuron body and can be wrapped in an insulating layer known as
myelin, which is formed by accessory cells. The synapse is the gap between nerve cells, or between a nerve cell and
its target, for example, a muscle or a gland, across which the impulse is transmitted by chemical compounds known as

bones lose calcium and other minerals. With age, fluid decreases in the fibrous cartilage disks intercalated between the
vertebrae in the spine. Joints lose cartilage and stiffen. Many tissues, including those in muscles, lose mass through a

Wound healing is slower in the elderly, accompanied by a higher frequency of infection as the capacity of the immune
system to fend off pathogen declines.
Aging is also apparent at the cellular level because all cells experience changes with aging. Telomeres, regions of the
chromosomes necessary for cell division, shorten each time cells divide. As they do, cells are less able to divide and
regenerate.Becauseofalterationsincellmembranes,transportofoxygenandnutrientsintothecellandremovalofcarbon

The progressive impact of aging on the body varies considerably among individuals, but Studies indicate, however, that
exercise and healthy lifestyle choices can slow down the deterioration of the body that comes with old age.

Watch thisvideo (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/tumor)to learn more about tumors. What is a tumor?
Cancer treatments vary depending on the disease’s type and stage. Traditional approaches, including surgery, radiation,
chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy, aim to remove or kill rapidly dividing cancer cells, but these strategies have their
limitations. Depending on a tumor’s location, for example, cancer surgeons may be unable to remove it. Radiation and
chemotherapy are difficult, and it is often impossible to target only the cancer cells. The treatments inevitably destroy
healthy tissue as well. To address this, researchers are working on pharmaceuticals that can target specific proteins
implicated in cancer-associated molecular pathways.

CHAPTER REVIEW
4.1Types of Tissues
The human body contains more than 200 types of cells that can all be classified into four types of tissues: epithelial,
connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial tissues act as coverings controlling the movement of materials across the
surface.Connectivetissueintegratesthevariouspartsofthebodyandprovidessupportandprotectiontoorgans.Muscle
tissue allows the body to move. Nervous tissues propagate information.
Thestudyoftheshapeandarrangementofcellsintissueiscalledhistology.Allcellsandtissuesinthebodyderivefrom
three germ layers in the embryo: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.
Differenttypesoftissuesformmembranesthatencloseorgans,provideafriction-freeinteractionbetweenorgans,andkeep
organstogether.Synovialmembranesareconnectivetissuemembranesthatprotectandlinethejoints.Epithelialmembranes
are formed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of connective tissue. There are three types of epithelial membranes:
mucous, which contain glands; serous, which secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the skin.
4.2Epithelial Tissue
Inepithelialtissue,cellsarecloselypackedwithlittleornoextracellularmatrixexceptforthebasallaminathatseparates
the epithelium from underlying tissue. The main functions of epithelia are protection from the environment, coverage,
secretion and excretion, absorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by tight junctions that form an impermeable
barrier.Theycanalsobeconnectedbygapjunctions,whichallowfreeexchangeofsolublemoleculesbetweencells,and
anchoringjunctions,whichattachcelltocellorcelltomatrix.Thedifferenttypesofepithelialtissuesarecharacterizedby
theircellularshapesandarrangements:squamous,cuboidal,orcolumnarepithelia.Singlecelllayersformsimpleepithelia,
whereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very few capillaries penetrate these tissues.
Glands are secretory tissues and organs that are derived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release their products
throughducts.Endocrineglandssecretehormonesdirectlyintotheinterstitialfluidandbloodstream.Glandsareclassified
bothaccording tothe type ofsecretion andbytheir structure. Merocrine glands secrete products as they are synthesized.

secretions until they rupture and release their contents. In this case, the cell becomes part of the secretion.

4.5Nervous Tissue Mediates Perception and Response
The most prominent cell of the nervous tissue, the neuron, is characterized mainly by its ability to receive stimuli and
respond by generating an electrical signal, known as an action potential, which can travel rapidly over great distances in
the body. A typical neuron displays a distinctive morphology: a large cell body branches out into short extensions called
dendrites, which receive chemical signals from other neurons, and a long tail called an axon, which relays signals away
fromthecelltootherneurons,muscles,orglands.Manyaxonsarewrappedbyamyelinsheath,alipidderivativethatacts

the astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells.
4.6Tissue Injury and Aging
Inflammation is the classic response of the body to injury and follows a common sequence of events. The area is red,
feelswarmtothetouch,swells,andispainful.Injuredcells,mastcells,andresidentmacrophagesreleasechemicalsignals
that cause vasodilation and fluid leakage in the surrounding tissue. The repair phase includes blood clotting, followed
byregenerationoftissueasfibroblastsdepositcollagen.Sometissuesregeneratemorereadilythanothers.Epithelialand
connective tissues replace damaged or dead cells from a supply of adult stem cells. Muscle and nervous tissues undergo
either slow regeneration or do not repair at all.
Age affects all the tissues and organs of the body. Damaged cells do not regenerate as rapidly as in younger people.

The epidermis is composed of keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium. It is made of four or five layers of epithelial
cells, depending on its location in the body. It does not have any blood vessels within it (i.e., it is avascular). Skin that
hasfourlayersofcellsisreferredtoas“thinskin.”Fromdeeptosuperficial,theselayersarethestratumbasale,stratum

an abundance of small blood vessels. In addition, the papillary layer contains phagocytes, defensive cells that help fight
bacteria or other infections that have breached the skin. This layer also contains lymphatic capillaries, nerve fibers, and
touch receptors called the Meissner corpuscles.

Lipid Storage
Thehypodermisishometomostofthefatthatconcernspeoplewhentheyaretryingtokeeptheirweightundercontrol.
Adipose tissue present in the hypodermis consists of fat-storing cells called adipocytes. This stored fat can serve as
an energy reserve, insulate the body to prevent heat loss, and act as a cushion to protect underlying structures from
trauma.
Where the fat is deposited and accumulates within the hypodermis depends on hormones (testosterone, estrogen,
insulin,glucagon,leptin,andothers),aswellasgeneticfactors.Fatdistributionchangesasourbodiesmatureandage.

Pigmentation
Thecolorofskinisinfluencedbyanumberofpigments,includingmelanin,carotene,andhemoglobin.Recallthatmelanin
is produced by cells called melanocytes, which are found scattered throughout the stratum basale of the epidermis. The
melanin is transferred into the keratinocytes via a cellular vesicle called amelanosome(Figure 5.8).

melanocytes in the stratum basale and taken up by keratinocytes.

Thefirstthingaclinicianseesistheskin,andsotheexaminationoftheskinshouldbepartofanythoroughphysical
examination. Most skin disorders are relatively benign, but a few, including melanomas, can be fatal if untreated.
A couple of the more noticeable disorders, albinism and vitiligo, affect the appearance of the skin and its accessory
organs. Although neither is fatal, it would be hard to claim that they are benign, at least to the individuals so afflicted.
Albinism is a genetic disorder that affects (completely or partially) the coloring of skin, hair, and eyes. The defect
is primarily due to the inability of melanocytes to produce melanin. Individuals with albinism tend to appear white
or very pale due to the lack of melanin in their skin and hair. Recall that melanin helps protect the skin from the
harmful effects of UV radiation. Individuals with albinism tend to need more protection from UV radiation, as they

Neither albinism nor vitiligo directly affects the lifespan of an individual.

appearing yellow or jaundiced (jaune is the French word for “yellow”). Tumors of the pituitary gland can result in
the secretion of large amounts of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which results in a darkening of the skin.
Similarly, Addison’s disease can stimulate the release of excess amounts of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH),
which can give the skin a deep bronze color. A sudden drop in oxygenation can affect skin color, causing the skin
to initially turn ashen (white). With a prolonged reduction in oxygen levels, dark red deoxyhemoglobin becomes

Sensory Function
Thefactthatyoucanfeelanantcrawlingonyourskin,allowingyoutoflickitoffbeforeitbites,isbecausetheskin,and
especially the hairs projecting from hair follicles in the skin, can sense changes in the environment. The hair root plexus
surrounding the base of the hair follicle senses a disturbance, and then transmits the information to the central nervous
system(brainandspinalcord),whichcanthenrespondbyactivatingtheskeletalmusclesofyoureyestoseetheantandthe
skeletal muscles of the body to act against the ant.
The skin acts as a sense organ because the epidermis, dermis, and the hypodermis contain specialized sensory nerve
structuresthatdetecttouch,surfacetemperature,andpain.Thesereceptorsaremoreconcentratedonthetipsofthefingers,

Thermoregulation
The integumentary system helps regulate body temperature through its tight association with the sympathetic nervous
system, the division of the nervous system involved in our fight-or-flight responses. The sympathetic nervous system is
continuouslymonitoringbodytemperatureandinitiatingappropriatemotorresponses.Recallthatsweatglands,accessory

Integumentary System
All systems in the body accumulate subtle and some not-so-subtle changes as a person ages. Among these changes
are reductions in cell division, metabolic activity, blood circulation, hormonal levels, and muscle strength (Figure
5.17).Intheskin,thesechangesarereflectedindecreasedmitosisinthestratumbasale,leadingtoathinnerepidermis.
Thedermis,whichisresponsiblefortheelasticityandresilienceoftheskin,exhibitsareducedabilitytoregenerate,
which leads to slower wound healing. The hypodermis, with its fat stores, loses structure due to the reduction and
redistribution of fat, which in turn contributes to the thinning and sagging of skin.

5.4 | Diseases, Disorders, and Injuries of the
Integumentary System
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe several different diseases and disorders of the skin
• Describe the effect of injury to the skin and the process of healing
The integumentary system is susceptible to a variety of diseases, disorders, and injuries. These range from annoying but
relativelybenignbacterialorfungalinfectionsthatarecategorizedasdisorders,toskincancerandsevereburns,whichcan
be fatal. In this section, you will learn several of the most common skin conditions.
Diseases
One of the most talked about diseases is skin cancer. Cancer is a broad term that describes diseases caused by abnormal
cellsinthebodydividinguncontrollably.Mostcancersareidentifiedbytheorganortissueinwhichthecanceroriginates.

that there are additional factors that can lead to cancerous lesions.
In general, cancers result from an accumulation of DNA mutations. These mutations can result in cell populations that
do not die when they should and uncontrolled cell proliferation that leads to tumors. Although many tumors are benign
(harmless),someproducecellsthatcanmobilizeandestablishtumorsinotherorgansofthebody;thisprocessisreferred
to asmetastasis. Cancers are characterized by their ability to metastasize.

skin cancer, it is readily cured if caught early and treated. (credit: John Hendrix, MD)
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinoma is a cancer that affects the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum and presents as lesions
commonly found on the scalp, ears, and hands (Figure 5.19). It is the second most common skin cancer. The American
Cancer Society reports that two of 10 skin cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, and it is more aggressive than basal
cell carcinoma. If not removed, these carcinomas can metastasize. Surgery and radiation are used to cure squamous cell
carcinoma.

Melanoma
A melanoma is a cancer characterized by the uncontrolled growth of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the
epidermis. Typically, a melanoma develops from a mole. It is the most fatal of all skin cancers, as it is highly metastatic
andcanbedifficulttodetectbeforeithasspreadtootherorgans.Melanomasusuallyappearasasymmetrical brownand
blackpatcheswithunevenbordersandaraisedsurface(Figure5.20).Treatmenttypicallyinvolvessurgicalexcisionand

DoctorsoftengivetheirpatientsthefollowingABCDEmnemonictohelpwiththediagnosisofearly-stagemelanoma.If
you observe a mole on your body displaying these signs, consult a doctor.
• Asymmetry – the two sides are not symmetrical
• Borders – the edges are irregular in shape
• Color – the color is varied shades of brown or black
• Diameter – it is larger than 6 mm (0.24 in)
• Evolving – its shape has changed
Some specialists cite the following additional signs for the most serious form, nodular melanoma:
• Elevated – it is raised on the skin surface
• Firm – it feels hard to the touch
• Growing – it is getting larger

Skin Disorders
Two common skin disorders are eczema and acne. Eczema is an inflammatory condition and occurs in individuals of all
ages.Acneinvolvesthecloggingofpores,whichcanleadtoinfectionandinflammation,andisoftenseeninadolescents.
Other disorders, not discussed here, include seborrheic dermatitis (on the scalp), psoriasis, cold sores, impetigo, scabies,
hives, and warts.
Eczema
Eczema is an allergic reaction that manifests as dry, itchy patches of skin that resemble rashes (Figure 5.21). It may be
accompaniedbyswellingoftheskin,flaking,andinseverecases,bleeding.Manywhosufferfromeczemahaveantibodies

usually managed with moisturizers, corticosteroid creams, and immunosuppressants.

Acne
Acne is a skin disturbance that typically occurs on areas of the skin that are rich in sebaceous glands (face and back).
It is most common along with the onset of puberty due to associated hormonal changes, but can also occur in infants
and continue into adulthood. Hormones, such as androgens, stimulate the release of sebum. An overproduction and
accumulationofsebumalongwithkeratincanblockhairfollicles.Thisplugisinitiallywhite.Thesebum,whenoxidizedby

Dermatologist
Have you ever had a skin rash that did not respond to over-the-counter creams, or a mole that you were concerned
about? Dermatologists help patients with these types of problems and more, on a daily basis. Dermatologists are
medical doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating skin disorders. Like all medical doctors, dermatologists
earn a medical degree and then complete several years of residency training. In addition, dermatologists may then
participate in a dermatology fellowship or complete additional, specialized training in a dermatology practice. If
practicing in the United States, dermatologists must pass the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE),
become licensed in their state of practice, and be certified by the American Board of Dermatology.
Most dermatologists work in a medical office or private-practice setting. They diagnose skin conditions and rashes,
prescribeoralandtopicalmedicationstotreatskinconditions,andmayperformsimpleprocedures,suchasmoleor
wartremoval. Inaddition, theymayreferpatients toanoncologist ifskincancer thathasmetastasized issuspected.
Recently,cosmeticprocedureshavealsobecomeaprominentpartofdermatology.Botoxinjections,lasertreatments,
and collagen and dermal filler injections are popular among patients, hoping to reduce the appearance of skin aging.
Dermatologyisacompetitivespecialtyinmedicine.Limitedopeningsindermatologyresidencyprogramsmeanthat
many medical students compete for a few select spots. Dermatology is an appealing specialty to many prospective
doctors, because unlike emergency room physicians or surgeons, dermatologists generally do not have to work
excessivehoursorbe“on-call”weekendsandholidays.Moreover,thepopularityofcosmeticdermatologyhasmade
it a growing field with many lucrative opportunities. It is not unusual for dermatology clinics to market themselves
exclusively as cosmetic dermatology centers, and for dermatologists to specialize exclusively in these procedures.
Consider visiting a dermatologist to talk about why he or she entered the field and what the field of dermatology is
like. Visit thissite (http://www.Diplomaguide.com)for additional information.

Bedsores and Stretch Marks
Skin and its underlying tissue can be affected by excessive pressure. One example of this is called a bedsore. Bedsores,

CHAPTER REVIEW
5.1Layers of the Skin
Theskiniscomposedoftwomajorlayers:asuperficialepidermisandadeeperdermis.Theepidermisconsistsofseveral
layers beginning with the innermost (deepest) stratum basale (germinatum), followed by the stratum spinosum, stratum
granulosum,stratumlucidum(whenpresent),andendingwiththeoutermostlayer,thestratumcorneum.Thetopmostlayer,
the stratum corneum, consists of dead cells that shed periodically and is progressively replaced by cells formed from the
basallayer.Thestratumbasalealsocontainsmelanocytes,cellsthatproducemelanin,thepigmentprimarilyresponsiblefor
giving skin its color. Melanin is transferred to keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum to protect cells from UV rays.
Thedermisconnectstheepidermistothehypodermis,andprovidesstrengthandelasticityduetothepresenceofcollagen
and elastin fibers. It has only two layers: the papillary layer with papillae that extend into the epidermis and the lower,
reticular layer composed of loose connective tissue. The hypodermis, deep to the dermis of skin, is the connective tissue
that connects the dermis to underlying structures; it also harbors adipose tissue for fat storage and protection.
5.2Accessory Structures of the Skin
Accessorystructuresoftheskinincludehair,nails,sweatglands,andsebaceousglands.Hairismadeofdeadkeratinized

and shape. Unlike a fossil skeleton, however, your skeleton is a structure of living tissue that grows, repairs, and renews
itself. The bones within it are dynamic and complex organs that serve a number of important functions, including some
necessary to maintain homeostasis.
6.1 | The Functions of the Skeletal System
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define bone, cartilage, and the skeletal system
• List and describe the functions of the skeletal system
Bone, or osseous tissue, is a hard, dense connective tissue that forms most of the adult skeleton, the support structure
of the body. In the areas of the skeleton where bones move (for example, the ribcage and joints), cartilage, a semi-rigid
formofconnectivetissue,providesflexibilityandsmoothsurfacesformovement.Theskeletalsystemisthebodysystem
composed of bones and cartilage and performs the following critical functions for the human body:
• supports the body
• facilitates movement
• protects internal organs
• produces blood cells
• stores and releases minerals and fat

Orthopedist
An orthopedist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders and injuries related to the
musculoskeletal system. Some orthopedic problems can be treated with medications, exercises, braces, and other
devices, but others may be best treated with surgery (Figure 6.4).
Figure6.4ArmBraceAnorthopedistwillsometimesprescribetheuseofabracethatreinforcestheunderlying
bone structure it is being used to support. (credit: Juhan Sonin)
Whiletheoriginoftheword“orthopedics”(ortho-=“straight”;paed-=“child”),literallymeans“straighteningofthe
child,” orthopedists can have patients who range from pediatric to geriatric. In recent years, orthopedists have even
performedprenatalsurgerytocorrectspinabifida,acongenitaldefectinwhichtheneuralcanalinthespineofthefetus
fails to close completely during embryologic development.
Orthopedists commonly treat bone and joint injuries but they also treat other bone conditions including curvature
of the spine. Lateral curvatures (scoliosis) can be severe enough to slip under the shoulder blade (scapula) forcing
it up as a hump. Spinal curvatures can also be excessive dorsoventrally (kyphosis) causing a hunch back and
thoracic compression. These curvatures often appear in preteens as the result of poor posture, abnormal growth, or
indeterminate causes. Mostly, they are readily treated by orthopedists. As people age, accumulated spinal column

and complex injuries, such as a torn rotator cuff in the shoulder. Treatment can range from exercise to surgery.
Mineral Storage, Energy Storage, and Hematopoiesis
On a metabolic level, bone tissue performs several critical functions. For one, the bone matrix acts as a reservoir for
a number of minerals important to the functioning of the body, especially calcium, and potassium. These minerals,
incorporatedintobonetissue,canbereleasedbackintothebloodstreamtomaintainlevelsneededtosupportphysiological
processes.Calciumions,forexample,areessentialformusclecontractionsandcontrollingtheflowofotherionsinvolved

Bonealsoservesasasiteforfatstorageandbloodcellproduction.Thesofterconnectivetissuethatfillstheinteriorofmost
bone is referred to as bone marrow (Figure 6.5). There are two types of bone marrow: yellow marrow and red marrow.
Yellow marrow contains adipose tissue; the triglycerides stored in the adipocytes of the tissue can serve as a source of
energy.Red marrow is where hematopoiesis—the production ofblood cells—takes place. Red blood cells, white blood
cells, and platelets are all produced in the red marrow.

6.2 | Bone Classification
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Classify bones according to their shapes
• Describe the function of each category of bones
The206bonesthat compose theadult skeleton aredivided intofivecategories basedontheir shapes (Figure6.6).Their
shapes and their functions are related such that each categorical shape of bone has a distinct function.

Flat Bones
The term “ flat bone” is somewhat of a misnomer because, although a flat bone is typically thin, it is also often curved.
Examplesincludethecranial(skull)bones,thescapulae(shoulderblades),thesternum(breastbone),andtheribs.Flatbones
serve as points of attachment for muscles and often protect internal organs.
Irregular Bones

Sesamoid Bones
A sesamoid bone is a small, round bone that, as the name suggests, is shaped like a sesame seed. These bones form
in tendons (the sheaths of tissue that connect bones to muscles) where a great deal of pressure is generated in a joint.

The medullary cavity has a delicate membranous lining called the endosteum (end- = “inside”; oste- = “bone”), where
bone growth, repair, and remodeling occur. The outer surface of the bone is covered with a fibrous membrane called the
periosteum(peri-=“around”or“surrounding”).Theperiosteumcontainsbloodvessels,nerves,andlymphaticvesselsthat

214 CHAPTER 6 | BONE TISSUE AND THE SKELETAL SYSTEM
Figure 6.11 Bone Cells Four types of cells are found within bone tissue. Osteogenic cells are undifferentiated
and develop into osteoblasts. When osteoblasts get trapped within the calcified matrix, their structure and function
changes, and they become osteocytes. Osteoclasts develop from monocytes and macrophages and differ in

The microscopic structural unit of compact bone is called an osteon, or Haversian system. Each osteon is composed of
concentric rings of calcified matrix called lamellae (singular = lamella). Running down the center of each osteon is the
centralcanal,orHaversiancanal,whichcontainsbloodvessels,nerves,andlymphaticvessels.Thesevesselsandnerves

in the skull, Paget’s disease can cause headaches and hearing loss.
Figure6.14Paget'sDiseaseNormallegbonesarerelativelystraight,butthoseaffectedbyPaget’sdiseaseare

Whatcausestheosteoclaststobecomeoveractive?Theanswerisstillunknown,buthereditaryfactorsseemtoplaya
role. Some scientists believe Paget’s disease is due to an as-yet-unidentified virus.
Paget’s disease is diagnosed via imaging studies and lab tests. X-rays may show bone deformities or areas of bone
resorption. Bone scans are also useful. In these studies, a dye containing a radioactive ion is injected into the body.
Areas of bone resorption have an affinity for the ion, so they will light up on the scan if the ions are absorbed. In
addition, blood levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase are typically elevated in people with Paget’s disease.
Bisphosphonates, drugs that decrease the activity of osteoclasts, are often used in the treatment of Paget’s disease.
However,inasmallpercentageofcases,bisphosphonatesthemselveshavebeenlinkedtoanincreasedriskoffractures

6.4 | Bone Formation and Development
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the function of cartilage
• List the steps of intramembranous ossification
• List the steps of endochondral ossification
• Explain the growth activity at the epiphyseal plate
• Compare and contrast the processes of modeling and remodeling
Intheearlystagesofembryonicdevelopment,theembryo’sskeletonconsistsoffibrousmembranesandhyalinecartilage.
Bythesixthorseventhweekofembryoniclife,theactualprocessofbonedevelopment,ossification(osteogenesis),begins.
There are two osteogenic pathways—intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification—but bone is the same
regardless of the pathway that produces it.
Cartilage Templates
Bone is a replacement tissue; that is, it uses a model tissue on which to lay down its mineral matrix. For skeletal
development,themostcommontemplateiscartilage.Duringfetaldevelopment,aframeworkislaiddownthatdetermines
where bones will form. This framework is a flexible, semi-solid matrix produced by chondroblasts and consists of
hyaluronicacid,chondroitinsulfate,collagenfibers,andwater.Asthematrixsurroundsandisolateschondroblasts,theyare
calledchondrocytes.Unlikemostconnectivetissues,cartilageisavascular,meaningthatithasnobloodvesselssupplying

Throughoutfetaldevelopmentandintochildhoodgrowthanddevelopment,boneformsonthecartilaginousmatrix.Bythe
timeafetusisborn,mostofthecartilagehasbeenreplacedwithbone.Someadditionalcartilagewillbereplacedthroughout
childhood, and some cartilage remains in the adult skeleton.
Intramembranous Ossification
During intramembranous ossification, compact and spongy bone develops directly from sheets of mesenchymal
(undifferentiated)connectivetissue.Theflatbonesoftheface,mostofthecranialbones,andtheclavicles(collarbones)are
formed via intramembranous ossification.
The process begins when mesenchymal cells in the embryonic skeleton gather together and begin to differentiate into
specializedcells(Figure6.16a).Someofthesecellswilldifferentiateintocapillaries,whileotherswillbecomeosteogenic
cells and then osteoblasts. Although they will ultimately be spread out by the formation of bone tissue, early osteoblasts
appear in a cluster called anossification center.
The osteoblasts secrete osteoid, uncalcified matrix, which calcifies (hardens) within a few days as mineral salts are
deposited on it, thereby entrapping the osteoblasts within. Once entrapped, the osteoblasts become osteocytes (Figure
6.16b).Asosteoblaststransformintoosteocytes,osteogeniccellsinthesurroundingconnectivetissuedifferentiateintonew
osteoblasts.
Osteoid (unmineralized bone matrix) secreted around the capillaries results in a trabecular matrix, while osteoblasts on
the surface of the spongy bone become the periosteum (Figure 6.16c). The periosteum then creates a protective layer
of compact bone superficial to the trabecular bone. The trabecular bone crowds nearby blood vessels, which eventually
condense into red marrow (Figure 6.16d).

face, which reach their adult size at the end of the adolescent growth spurt.
Endochondral Ossification
In endochondral ossification, bone develops by replacing hyaline cartilage. Cartilage does not become bone. Instead,
cartilage serves as a template to be completely replaced by new bone. Endochondral ossification takes much longer than
intramembranous ossification. Bones at the base of the skull and long bones form via endochondral ossification.
In a long bone, for example, at about 6 to 8 weeks after conception, some of the mesenchymal cells differentiate into
chondrocytes (cartilage cells) that form the cartilaginous skeletal precursor of the bones (Figure 6.17a). Soon after, the
perichondrium, a membrane that covers the cartilage, appearsFigure 6.17b).

Asthecartilagegrows,capillaries penetrateit.Thispenetrationinitiatesthetransformationoftheperichondriumintothe
bone-producing periosteum. Here, the osteoblasts form a periosteal collar of compact bone around the cartilage of the
diaphysis. By the second or third month of fetal life, bone cell development and ossification ramps up and creates the
primary ossification center, a region deep in the periosteal collar where ossification begins (Figure 6.17c).
While these deep changes are occurring, chondrocytes and cartilage continue to grow at the ends of the bone (the future
epiphyses),whichincreasesthebone’slengthatthesametimeboneisreplacingcartilageinthediaphyses.Bythetimethe

seedingwithosteogeniccellsthatbecomeosteoblasts)occursintheepiphysealregions,andeachofthesecentersofactivity
is referred to as asecondary ossification center(Figure 6.17e).
How Bones Grow in Length
The epiphyseal plate is the area of growth in a long bone. It is a layer of hyaline cartilage where ossification occurs in
immature bones. On the epiphyseal side of the epiphyseal plate, cartilage is formed. On the diaphyseal side, cartilage is
ossified, andthediaphysis growsinlength. Theepiphyseal plate iscomposed offourzonesofcells andactivity (Figure

proliferative zone and the maturation of cells in the zone of maturation and hypertrophy.
Most of the chondrocytes in the zone of calcified matrix, the zone closest to the diaphysis, are dead because the matrix
around them has calcified. Capillaries and osteoblasts from the diaphysis penetrate this zone, and the osteoblasts secrete
bone tissue on the remaining calcified cartilage. Thus, the zone of calcified matrix connects the epiphyseal plate to the
diaphysis. A bone grows in length when osseous tissue is added to the diaphysis.
Bones continue to grow in length until early adulthood. The rate of growth is controlled by hormones, which will be
discussed later. When the chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate cease their proliferation and bone replaces the cartilage,
longitudinal growth stops. All that remains of the epiphyseal plate is theepiphyseal line(Figure 6.19).
Figure 6.19 Progression from Epiphyseal Plate to Epiphyseal Line As a bone matures, the epiphyseal plate
progresses to an epiphyseal line. (a) Epiphyseal plates are visible in a growing bone. (b) Epiphyseal lines are the
remnants of epiphyseal plates in a mature bone.
How Bones Grow in Diameter
While bones are increasing in length, they are also increasing in diameter; growth in diameter can continue even after

Bone Remodeling
The process in which matrix is resorbed on one surface of a bone and deposited on another is known as bone modeling.
Modeling primarily takes place during a bone’s growth. However, in adult life, bone undergoes remodeling, in which

from the small intestine without vitamin D. Therefore, intake of vitamin D is also critical to bone health. In addition to
vitamin D’s role in calcium absorption, it also plays a role, though not as clearly understood, in bone remodeling.
Milk and other dairy foods are not the only sources of calcium. This important nutrient is also found in green leafy
vegetables,broccoli,andintactsalmonandcannedsardineswiththeirsoftbones.Nuts,beans,seeds,andshellfishprovide
calcium in smaller quantities.

those of darker complexion and those living in northern latitudes where the sun’s rays are not as strong, are deficient in
vitamin D. In cases of deficiency, a doctor can prescribe a vitamin D supplement.
Figure 6.22Synthesis of Vitamin D Sunlight is one source of vitamin D.
Other Nutrients
Vitamin K also supports bone mineralization and may have a synergistic role with vitamin D in the regulation of bone
growth. Green leafy vegetables are a good source of vitamin K.

of bone. Fluoride can displace the hydroxyl group in bone’s hydroxyapatite crystals and form fluorapatite. Similar to its
effect on dental enamel, fluorapatite helps stabilize and strengthen bone mineral. Fluoride can also enter spaces within
hydroxyapatite crystals, thus increasing their density.

Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by a decrease in bone mass that occurs when the rate of bone resorption
exceedstherateofboneformation,acommonoccurrenceasthebodyages.NoticehowthisisdifferentfromPaget’s

While osteoporosis can involve any bone, it most commonly affects the proximal ends of the femur, vertebrae, and

For many elderly people, a hip fracture can be life threatening. The fracture itself may not be serious, but the
immobility that comes during the healing process can lead to the formation of blood clots that can lodge in the
capillaries of the lungs, resulting in respiratory failure; pneumonia due to the lack of poor air exchange that
accompaniesimmobility;pressuresores(bedsores)thatallowpathogenstoenterthebodyandcauseinfections;and

Current treatments for managing osteoporosis include bisphosphonates (the same medications often used in Paget’s
disease),calcitonin,andestrogen(forwomenonly).Minimizingtheriskoffalls,forexample,byremovingtripping
hazards, is also an important step in managing the potential outcomes from the disease.

Hormones That Influence Osteoclasts
Bonemodelingandremodelingrequireosteoclaststoresorbunneeded,damaged,oroldbone,andosteoblaststolaydown
new bone. Two hormones that affect the osteoclasts are parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin.
PTHstimulatesosteoclastproliferationandactivity.Asaresult,calciumisreleasedfromthebonesintothecirculation,thus
increasingthecalciumionconcentrationintheblood.PTHalsopromotesthereabsorptionofcalciumbythekidneytubules,
which can affect calcium homeostasis (see below).
ThesmallintestineisalsoaffectedbyPTH,albeitindirectly.BecauseanotherfunctionofPTHistostimulatethesynthesis
ofvitaminD,andbecausevitaminDpromotesintestinalabsorptionofcalcium,PTHindirectlyincreasescalciumuptake
by the small intestine. Calcitonin, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, has some effects that counteract those of
PTH. Calcitonin inhibits osteoclast activity and stimulates calcium uptake by the bones, thus reducing the concentration
of calcium ions in the blood. As evidenced by their opposing functions in maintaining calcium homeostasis, PTH and
calcitonin are generally not secreted at the same time. Table 6.6 summarizes the hormones that influence the skeletal
system.

Calcium is a chemical element that cannot be produced by any biological processes. The only way it can enter the body
isthroughthediet.Thebonesactasastoragesiteforcalcium:Thebodydepositscalciumintheboneswhenbloodlevels
get too high, and it releases calcium when blood levels drop too low. This process is regulated by PTH, vitamin D, and
calcitonin.
Cellsoftheparathyroidglandhaveplasmamembranereceptorsforcalcium.Whencalciumisnotbindingtothesereceptors,
thecellsreleasePTH,whichstimulatesosteoclastproliferationandresorptionofbonebyosteoclasts.Thisdemineralization
process releases calcium into the blood. PTH promotes reabsorption of calcium from the urine by the kidneys, so that
the calcium returns to the blood. Finally, PTH stimulates the synthesis of vitamin D, which in turn, stimulates calcium
absorption from any digested food in the small intestine.
Whenalltheseprocessesreturnbloodcalciumlevelstonormal,thereisenoughcalciumtobindwiththereceptorsonthe
surface of the cells of the parathyroid glands, and this cycle of events is turned off (Figure 6.24).
Whenbloodlevelsofcalciumgettoohigh,thethyroidglandisstimulatedtoreleasecalcitonin(Figure6.24),whichinhibits

All of these actions lower blood levels of calcium. When blood calcium levels return to normal, the thyroid gland stops
secreting calcitonin.

CHAPTER REVIEW
6.1The Functions of the Skeletal System
The major functions of the bones are body support, facilitation of movement, protection of internal organs, storage of
mineralsandfat,andhematopoiesis.Together,themuscularsystemandskeletalsystemareknownasthemusculoskeletal
system.
6.2Bone Classification
Bonescanbeclassifiedaccordingtotheirshapes.Longbones,suchasthefemur,arelongerthantheyarewide.Shortbones,

small and round, and are located in tendons.
6.3Bone Structure
A hollow medullary cavity filled with yellow marrow runs the length of the diaphysis of a long bone. The walls of the
diaphysis are compact bone. The epiphyses, which are wider sections at each end of a long bone, are filled with spongy
boneandredmarrow.Theepiphysealplate,alayerofhyalinecartilage,isreplacedbyosseoustissueastheorgangrowsin

Osteogenic cells develop into osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are cells that make new bone. They become osteocytes, the cells
of mature bone, when they get trapped in the matrix. Osteoclasts engage in bone resorption. Compact bone is dense and
composedofosteons,whilespongyboneislessdenseandmadeupoftrabeculae.Bloodvesselsandnervesenterthebone
through the nutrient foramina to nourish and innervate bones.
6.4Bone Formation and Development
All bone formation is a replacement process. Embryos develop a cartilaginous skeleton and various membranes. During
development, thesearereplacedbyboneduringtheossification process.Inintramembranous ossification, bonedevelops
directlyfromsheetsofmesenchymalconnectivetissue.Inendochondralossification,bonedevelopsbyreplacinghyaline
cartilage. Activity in the epiphyseal plate enables bones to grow in length. Modeling allows bones to grow in diameter.
Remodelingoccursasboneisresorbedandreplacedbynewbone.Osteogenesisimperfectaisageneticdiseaseinwhich
collagen production is altered, resulting in fragile, brittle bones.
6.5Fractures: Bone Repair
Fractured bones may be repaired by closed reduction or open reduction. Fractures are classified by their complexity,
location,andotherfeatures.Commontypesoffracturesaretransverse,oblique,spiral,comminuted,impacted,greenstick,
open(orcompound),andclosed (orsimple). Healing offractures beginswiththeformation ofahematoma, followed by
internalandexternalcalli.Osteoclastsresorbdeadbone,whileosteoblastscreatenewbonethatreplacesthecartilageinthe
calli. The calli eventually unite, remodeling occurs, and healing is complete.
6.6Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones, and Bone Tissue
Mechanical stress stimulates the deposition of mineral salts and collagen fibers within bones. Calcium, the predominant
mineralinbone,cannotbeabsorbedfromthesmallintestineifvitaminDislacking.VitaminKsupportsbonemineralization
and may have a synergistic role with vitamin D. Magnesium and fluoride, as structural elements, play a supporting role
in bone health. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation and may promote production of new osseous tissue. Growth
hormone increases the length of long bones, enhances mineralization, and improves bone density. Thyroxine stimulates
236 CHAPTER 6 | BONE TISSUE AND THE SKELETAL SYSTEM
bone growth and promotes the synthesis of bone matrix. The sex hormones (estrogen in women; testosterone in men)
promote osteoblastic activity and the production of bone matrix, are responsible for the adolescent growth spurt, and
promoteclosureoftheepiphysealplates.Osteoporosisisadiseasecharacterizedbydecreasedbonemassthatiscommon
in aging adults. Calcitriol stimulates the digestive tract to absorb calcium and phosphate. Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
stimulates osteoclast proliferation and resorption of bone by osteoclasts. Vitamin D plays a synergistic role with PTH in
stimulating the osteoclasts. Additional functions of PTH include promoting reabsorption of calcium by kidney tubules
andindirectlyincreasingcalciumabsorptionfromthesmallintestine.Calcitonininhibitsosteoclastactivityandstimulates
calcium uptake by bones.
6.7Calcium Homeostasis: Interactions of the Skeletal System and Other Organ Systems
Calcium homeostasis, i.e., maintaining a blood calcium level of about 10 mg/dL, is critical for normal body functions.
Hypocalcemia can result in problems with blood coagulation, muscle contraction, nerve functioning, and bone strength.
Hypercalcemia can result in lethargy, sluggish reflexes, constipation and loss of appetite, confusion, and coma. Calcium
homeostasisiscontrolledbyPTH,vitaminD,andcalcitoninandtheinteractionsoftheskeletal,endocrine,digestive,and
urinary systems.

Lateral View of Skull
A view of the lateral skull is dominated by the large, rounded brain case above and the upper and lower jaws with their

On the lateral side of the brain case, above the level of the zygomatic arch, is a shallow space called the temporal
fossa. Below the level of the zygomatic arch and deep to the vertical portion of the mandible is another space called the
infratemporal fossa. Both the temporal fossa and infratemporal fossa contain muscles that act on the mandible during
chewing.

Temporal Bone
The temporal bone forms the lower lateral side of the skull (see Figure 7.5). Common wisdom has it that the temporal
bone (temporal = “time”) is so named because this area of the head (the temple) is where hair typically first turns gray,
indicating the passage of time.

Important landmarks of the temporal bone, as shown inFigure 7.8, include the following:
• Externalacousticmeatus(earcanal)—Thisisthelargeopeningonthelateralsideoftheskullthatisassociatedwith
the ear.
• Internalacousticmeatus—Thisopeningislocatedinsidethecranialcavity,onthemedialsideofthepetrousridge.
It connects to the middle and inner ear cavities of the temporal bone.
• Mandibular fossa—This is the deep, oval-shaped depression located on the external base of the skull, just in
front of the external acoustic meatus. The mandible (lower jaw) joins with the skull at this site as part of the
temporomandibular joint, which allows for movements of the mandible during opening and closing of the mouth.
• Articular tubercle—The smooth ridge located immediately anterior to the mandibular fossa. Both the articular
tubercle and mandibular fossa contribute to the temporomandibular joint, the joint that provides for movements
between the temporal bone of the skull and the mandible.

Skeletal System
Headandtraumaticbraininjuriesaremajorcausesofimmediatedeathanddisability,withbleedingandinfectionsas
possibleadditionalcomplications.AccordingtotheCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention(2010),approximately
30percentofallinjury-relateddeathsintheUnitedStatesarecausedbyheadinjuries.Themajorityofheadinjuries
involve falls. They are most common among young children (ages 0–4 years), adolescents (15–19 years), and the
elderly (over 65 years). Additional causes vary, but prominent among these are automobile and motorcycle accidents.
Strong blows to the brain-case portion of the skull can produce fractures. These may result in bleeding inside the
skullwithsubsequentinjurytothebrain.Themostcommonisalinearskullfracture,inwhichfracturelinesradiate

that can damage the artery that passes through the carotid canal.
A blow to the lateral side of the head may fracture the bones of the pterion. The pterion is an important clinical
landmarkbecauselocatedimmediatelydeeptoitontheinsideoftheskullisamajorbranchofanarterythatsupplies
the skull and covering layers of the brain. A strong blow to this region can fracture the bones around the pterion.
If the underlying artery is damaged, bleeding can cause the formation of a hematoma (collection of blood) between
thebrainandinterioroftheskull.Asbloodaccumulates,itwillputpressureonthebrain.Symptomsassociatedwith
a hematoma may not be apparent immediately following the injury, but if untreated, blood accumulation will exert
increasing pressure on the brain and can result in death within a few hours.
View this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/headblow) to see how a blow to the head may produce a
contrecoup (counterblow) fracture of the basilar portion of the occipital bone on the base of the skull. Why may a
basilar fracture be life threatening?
Facial Bones of the Skull
The facial bones of the skull form the upper and lower jaws, the nose, nasal cavity and nasal septum, and the orbit. The
facialbonesinclude14bones,withsixpairedbonesandtwounpairedbones.Thepairedbonesarethemaxilla,palatine,
zygomatic, nasal, lacrimal, and inferior nasal conchae bones. The unpaired bones are the vomer and mandible bones.

The ramus on each side of the mandible has two upward-going bony projections. The more anterior projection is the
flattened coronoid process of the mandible, which provides attachment for one of the biting muscles. The posterior
projection is the condylar process of the mandible, which is topped by the oval-shaped condyle. The condyle of
the mandible articulates (joins) with the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal bone. Together these
articulationsformthetemporomandibularjoint,whichallowsforopeningandclosingofthemouth(seeFigure7.5).The
broad U-shaped curve located between the coronoid and condylar processes is themandibular notch.
Important landmarks for the mandible include the following:

• Carotid canal—This is the zig-zag passageway through which a major artery to the brain enters the skull. The
entrance to the carotid canal is located on the inferior aspect of the skull, anteromedial to the styloid process (see
Figure 7.8a). From here, the canal runs anteromedially within the bony base of the skull. Just above the foramen
lacerum, the carotid canal opens into the middle cranial cavity, near the posterior-lateral base of the sella turcica.

7.3 | The Vertebral Column
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe each region of the vertebral column and the number of bones in each region
• Discuss the curves of the vertebral column and how these change after birth
• Describe a typical vertebra and determine the distinguishing characteristics for vertebrae in each vertebral region
and features of the sacrum and the coccyx
• Define the structure of an intervertebral disc
• Determine the location of the ligaments that provide support for the vertebral column
The vertebral column is also known as the spinal column or spine (Figure 7.20). It consists of a sequence of vertebrae
(singular = vertebra), each of which is separated and united by an intervertebral disc. Together, the vertebrae and
intervertebraldiscsformthevertebralcolumn.Itisaflexiblecolumnthatsupportsthehead,neck,andbodyandallowsfor

Curvatures of the Vertebral Column
The adult vertebral column does not form a straight line, but instead has four curvatures along its length (see Figure
7.20).Thesecurvesincreasethevertebralcolumn’sstrength,flexibility,andabilitytoabsorbshock.Whentheloadonthe
spine is increased, by carrying a heavy backpack for example, the curvatures increase in depth (become more curved) to

Disorders associated with the curvature of the spine include kyphosis (an excessive posterior curvature of the thoracic
region), lordosis (an excessive anterior curvature of the lumbar region), and scoliosis (an abnormal, lateral curvature,
accompanied by twisting of the vertebral column).

In extreme cases, surgery may be required.
Excessive vertebral curves can be identified while an individual stands in the anatomical position. Observe the
vertebral profile from the side and then from behind to check for kyphosis or lordosis. Then have the person bend
forward. If scoliosis is present, an individual will have difficulty in bending directly forward, and the right and left
sides of the back will not be level with each other in the bent position.

the back. The vertebral spines can easily be felt as a series of bumps just under the skin down the middle of the back.
The transverse and spinous processes serve as important muscle attachment sites. A superior articular process extends

Intervertebral Discs and Ligaments of the Vertebral Column
The bodies of adjacent vertebrae are strongly anchored to each other by an intervertebral disc. This structure provides
padding between the bones during weight bearing, and because it can change shape, also allows for movement between
thevertebrae.Althoughthetotalamountofmovementavailablebetweenanytwoadjacentvertebraeissmall,whenthese
movementsaresummedtogetheralongtheentirelengthofthevertebralcolumn,largebodymovementscanbeproduced.
Ligaments that extend along the length of the vertebral column also contribute to its overall support and stability.
Intervertebral Disc
An intervertebral disc is a fibrocartilaginous pad that fills the gap between adjacent vertebral bodies (see Figure 7.24).
Each disc is anchored to the bodies of its adjacent vertebrae, thus strongly uniting these. The discs also provide padding
between vertebrae duringweight bearing. Because ofthis,intervertebral discs arethininthecervical regionandthickest
in the lumbar region, which carries the most body weight. In total, the intervertebral discs account for approximately 25
percentofyourbodyheightbetweenthetopofthepelvisandthebaseoftheskull.Intervertebraldiscsarealsoflexibleand
can change shape to allow for movements of the vertebral column.

Chiropractor
Chiropractors are health professionals who use nonsurgical techniques to help patients with musculoskeletal system
problems that involve the bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons, or nervous system. They treat problems such as neck
pain, back pain, joint pain, or headaches. Chiropractors focus on the patient’s overall health and can also provide
counselingrelatedtolifestyleissues,suchasdiet,exercise,orsleepproblems.Ifneeded,theywillreferthepatientto
other medical specialists.
Chiropractors use a drug-free, hands-on approach for patient diagnosis and treatment. They will perform a physical
exam, assess the patient’s posture and spine, and may perform additional diagnostic tests, including taking X-ray
images.Theyprimarilyusemanualtechniques,suchasspinalmanipulation,toadjustthepatient’sspineorotherjoints.
Theycanrecommendtherapeuticorrehabilitativeexercises,andsomealsoincludeacupuncture,massagetherapy,or
ultrasoundaspartofthetreatmentprogram.Inadditiontothoseingeneralpractice,somechiropractorsspecializein
sport injuries, neurology, orthopaedics, pediatrics, nutrition, internal disorders, or diagnostic imaging.
Tobecome a chiropractor,students must have 3–4years ofundergraduate education, attend an accredited, four-year
Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree program, and pass a licensure examination to be licensed for practice in their
state. With the aging of the baby-boom generation, employment for chiropractors is expected to increase.

7.5 | Embryonic Development of the Axial Skeleton
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss the two types of embryonic bone development within the skull
• Describe the development of the vertebral column and thoracic cage
The axial skeleton begins to form during early embryonic development. However, growth, remodeling, and ossification
(bone formation) continue for several decades after birth before the adult skeleton is fully formed. Knowledge of the
developmental processes that give rise to the skeleton is important for understanding the abnormalities that may arise in
skeletal structures.
Development of the Skull
During the third week of embryonic development, a rod-like structure called the notochord develops dorsally along the
length of the embryo. The tissue overlying the notochord enlarges and forms the neural tube, which will give rise to the
brainandspinalcord.Bythefourthweek,mesodermtissuelocatedoneithersideofthenotochordthickensandseparates
into a repeating series of block-like tissue structures, each of which is called a somite. As the somites enlarge, each one
willsplitintoseveralparts.Themostmedialofthesepartsiscalledasclerotome.Thesclerotomesconsistofanembryonic
tissue called mesenchyme, which will give rise to the fibrous connective tissues, cartilages, and bones of the body.
Thebonesoftheskullarisefrommesenchymeduringembryonicdevelopmentintwodifferentways.Thefirstmechanism
produces the bones that form the top and sides of the brain case. This involves the local accumulation of mesenchymal
cells at the site of the future bone. These cells then differentiate directly into bone producing cells, which form the skull
bones through the process of intramembranous ossification. As the brain case bones grow in the fetal skull, they remain
separated from each other by large areas of dense connective tissue, each of which is called a fontanelle (Figure 7.33).
Thefontanellesarethesoftspotsonaninfant’shead.Theyareimportantduringbirthbecausetheseareasallowtheskullto

parietalbones.Thefontanellesdecreaseinsizeanddisappearbyage2.However,theskullbonesremainedseparatedfrom

Thesecondmechanismforbonedevelopmentintheskullproducesthefacialbonesandfloorofthebraincase.Thisalso
beginswiththelocalizedaccumulationofmesenchymalcells.However,thesecellsdifferentiateintocartilagecells,which
produce a hyaline cartilage model of the future bone. As this cartilage model grows, it is gradually converted into bone
through the process of endochondral ossification. This is a slow process and the cartilage is not completely converted to
bone until the skull achieves its full adult size.
At birth, the brain case and orbits of the skull are disproportionally large compared to the bones of the jaws and lower
face.Thisreflectstherelativeunderdevelopmentofthemaxillaandmandible,whichlackteeth,andthesmallsizesofthe
paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. During early childhood, the mastoid process enlarges, the two halves of the mandible
andfrontalbonefusetogethertoformsinglebones,andtheparanasalsinusesenlarge.Thejawsalsoexpandastheteeth
begin to appear. These changes all contribute to the rapid growth and enlargement of the face during childhood.

after birth. At the time of birth, the facial bones are small and underdeveloped, and the mastoid process has not yet
formed.
Development of the Vertebral Column and Thoracic cage
Development of the vertebrae begins with the accumulation of mesenchyme cells from each sclerotome around the
notochord. These cells differentiate into a hyaline cartilage model for each vertebra, which then grow and eventually
ossifyintobonethroughtheprocessofendochondralossification.Asthedevelopingvertebraegrow,thenotochordlargely
disappears. However, small areas of notochord tissue persist between the adjacent vertebrae and this contributes to the
formation of each intervertebral disc.
The ribs and sternum also develop from mesenchyme. The ribs initially develop as part of the cartilage model for each
vertebra, but in the thorax region, the rib portion separates from the vertebra by the eighth week. The cartilage model of
the ribthen ossifies, except forthe anterior portion, which remains asthe costal cartilage. The sternum initially formsas
pairedhyalinecartilagemodelsoneithersideoftheanteriormidline,beginningduringthefifthweekofdevelopment.The
cartilagemodelsoftheribsbecomeattachedtothelateralsidesofthedevelopingsternum.Eventually,thetwohalvesofthe
cartilaginoussternumfusetogetheralongthemidlineandthenossifyintobone.Themanubriumandbodyofthesternum
are converted into bone first, with the xiphoid process remaining as cartilage until late in life.

the skull and body. What are the two mechanisms by which the bones of the body are formed and which bones are
formed by each mechanism?
276 CHAPTER 7 | AXIAL SKELETON
Craniosynostosis
The premature closure (fusion) of a suture line is a condition called craniosynostosis. This error in the normal
developmental process results in abnormal growth of the skull and deformity of the head. It is produced either by
defects in the ossification process of the skull bones or failure of the brain to properly enlarge. Genetic factors are
involved,buttheunderlyingcauseisunknown.Itisarelativelycommoncondition,occurringinapproximately1:2000
births,withmalesbeingmorecommonlyaffected.Primarycraniosynostosis involvestheearlyfusionofonecranial
suture, whereas complex craniosynostosis results from the premature fusion of several sutures.
Theearlyfusionofasutureinprimarycraniosynostosispreventsanyadditionalenlargementofthecranialbonesand

closureofthesagittalsuturepreventsgrowthacrossthetopofthehead.Thisiscompensatedbyupwardgrowthbythe
bones of the lateral skull, resulting in a long, narrow, wedge-shaped head. This condition, known as scaphocephaly,
accounts forapproximately 50percent ofcraniosynostosis abnormalities. Althoughtheskullismisshapen, thebrain
still has adequate room to grow and thus there is no accompanying abnormal neurological development.

which can alter or impede proper brain growth and development.
Cases of craniosynostosis are usually treated with surgery. A team of physicians will open the skull along the fused
suture, which will then allow the skull bones to resume their growth in this area. In some cases, parts of the skull
will be removed and replaced with an artificial plate. The earlier after birth that surgery is performed, the better the
outcome.Aftertreatment,mostchildrencontinuetogrowanddevelopnormallyanddonotexhibitanyneurological

292 CHAPTER 8 | THE APPENDICULAR SKELETON
Figure 8.3 Pectoral Girdle The pectoral girdle consists of the clavicle and the scapula, which serve to attach the
upper limb to the sternum of the axial skeleton.
The scapula (shoulder blade) lies on the posterior aspect of the shoulder. It is supported by the clavicle, which also
articulates with the humerus (arm bone) to form the shoulder joint. The scapula is a flat, triangular-shaped bone with a
prominent ridge running across its posterior surface. This ridge extends out laterally, where it forms the bony tip of the
shoulderandjoinswiththelateralendoftheclavicle.Byfollowingalongtheclavicle,youcanpalpateouttothebonytip

attachment sites for muscles that aid with movements of the shoulder and arm.
The right and left pectoral girdles are not joined to each other, allowing each to operate independently. In addition, the
clavicle of each pectoral girdle is anchored to the axial skeleton by a single, highly mobile joint. This allows for the
extensive mobility of the entire pectoral girdle, which in turn enhances movements of the shoulder and upper limb.
Clavicle

fortheupperlimb.Theclaviclealsotransmitsforcesactingontheupperlimbtothesternumandaxialskeleton.Finally,it
serves to protect the underlying nerves and blood vessels as they pass between the trunk of the body and the upper limb.
The clavicle has three regions: the medial end, the lateral end, and the shaft. The medial end, known as the sternal
end of the clavicle, has a triangular shape and articulates with the manubrium portion of the sternum. This forms
the sternoclavicular joint, which is the only bony articulation between the pectoral girdle of the upper limb and the
axial skeleton. This joint allows considerable mobility, enabling the clavicle and scapula to move in upward/downward
and anterior/posterior directions during shoulder movements. The sternoclavicular joint is indirectly supported by the
costoclavicularligament(costo-=“rib”),whichspansthesternalendoftheclavicleandtheunderlyingfirstrib.Thelateral
oracromialendoftheclaviclearticulateswiththeacromionofthescapula,theportionofthescapulathatformsthebony
tip ofthe shoulder.There are some sexdifferences inthe morphology ofthe clavicle. Inwomen, the clavicle tends tobe
shorter,thinner,andlesscurved.Inmen,theclavicleisheavierandlonger,andhasagreatercurvatureandroughersurfaces
where muscles attach, features that are more pronounced in manual workers.
The clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone in the body. Such breaks often occur because of the force exerted on
the clavicle when a person falls onto his or her outstretched arms, or when the lateral shoulder receives a strong blow.
Because the sternoclavicular joint is strong and rarely dislocated, excessive force results in the breaking of the clavicle,
usually between the middle and lateral portions of the bone. If the fracture is complete, the shoulder and lateral clavicle
fragment will drop due to the weight of the upper limb, causing the person to support the sagging limb with their other
hand. Muscles acting across the shoulder will also pull the shoulder and lateral clavicle anteriorly and medially, causing
theclaviclefragmentstooverride.Theclavicleoverliesmanyimportantbloodvesselsandnervesfortheupperlimb,but
fortunately,duetotheanteriordisplacement ofabrokenclavicle, thesestructuresarerarelyaffectedwhentheclavicle is

Scapula

scapulaislocatedontheposteriorsideoftheshoulder.Itissurroundedbymusclesonbothitsanterior(deep)andposterior
(superficial) sides, and thus does not articulate with the ribs of the thoracic cage.
The scapula has several important landmarks (Figure 8.4). The three margins or borders of the scapula, named for their
positions within the body, are the superior border of the scapula, the medial border of the scapula, and the lateral
border of the scapula. The suprascapular notch is located lateral to the midpoint of the superior border. The corners
of the triangular scapula, at either end of the medial border, are the superior angle of the scapula, located between the
medial and superior borders, and the inferior angle of the scapula, located between the medial and lateral borders. The
inferiorangleisthemostinferiorportionofthescapula,andisparticularlyimportantbecauseitservesastheattachment
pointforseveralpowerfulmusclesinvolvedinshoulderandupperlimbmovements.Theremainingcornerofthescapula,
between the superior and lateral borders, is the location of the glenoid cavity (glenoid fossa). This shallow depression
articulates with the humerus bone of the arm to form the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint). The small bony bumps
located immediately above and below the glenoid cavity are the supraglenoid tubercle and the infraglenoid tubercle,
respectively. These provide attachments for muscles of the arm.

these fossae provide large surface areas for the attachment of muscles that cross the shoulder joint to act on the humerus.
The acromioclavicular joint transmits forces from the upper limb to the clavicle. The ligaments around this joint are

• Explain the three regions of the hip bone and identify their bony landmarks
• Describe the openings of the pelvis and the boundaries of the greater and lesser pelvis
Thepelvicgirdle(hipgirdle)isformedbyasinglebone,thehipboneorcoxalbone(coxal=“hip”),whichservesasthe

Pelvis
The pelvis consists of four bones: the right and left hip bones, the sacrum, and the coccyx (see Figure 8.12). The pelvis

thisweighttothelowerlimbswhenstanding.Itservesasanattachmentpointfortrunkandlowerlimbmuscles,andalso

Whatisthelargeopeninginthebonypelvis,locatedbetweentheischiumandpubicregions,andwhattwopartsofthe
pubis contribute to the formation of this opening?
The sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments also help to define two openings on the posterolateral sides of the pelvis
through which muscles, nerves, and blood vessels for the lower limb exit. The superior opening is the greater sciatic
foramen. This large opening is formed by the greater sciatic notch of the hip bone, the sacrum, and the sacrospinous
ligament.Thesmaller,moreinferiorlessersciaticforamenisformedbythelessersciaticnotchofthehipbone,together
with the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments.
The space enclosed by the bony pelvis is divided into two regions (Figure 8.15). The broad, superior region, defined
laterallybythelarge,fan-likeportionoftheupperhipbone,iscalledthegreaterpelvis(greaterpelviccavity;falsepelvis).
Thisbroadareaisoccupiedbyportionsofthesmallandlargeintestines,andbecauseitismorecloselyassociatedwiththe
abdominal cavity, it is sometimes referred to as the false pelvis. More inferiorly, the narrow, rounded space of the lesser
pelvis (lesser pelvic cavity; true pelvis) contains the bladder and other pelvic organs, and thus is also known as the true
pelvis.Thepelvicbrim(alsoknownasthepelvicinlet)formsthesuperiormarginofthelesserpelvis,separatingitfrom

theinferiormarginofthepubicsymphysisanteriorly,andtheischiopubicramus,theischialtuberosity,thesacrotuberous

angled, giving it an anterosuperior (pelvic inlet) to posteroinferior (pelvic outlet) orientation.

Forensic Pathology and Forensic Anthropology
Aforensicpathologist(alsoknownasamedicalexaminer)isamedicallytrainedphysicianwhohasbeenspecifically
trained in pathology to examine the bodies of the deceased to determine the cause of death. A forensic pathologist
applies his or her understanding of disease as well as toxins, blood and DNA analysis, firearms and ballistics, and
otherfactorstoassessthecauseandmannerofdeath.Attimes,aforensicpathologistwillbecalledtotestifyunder
oathinsituationsthatinvolveapossiblecrime.Forensicpathologyisafieldthathasreceivedmuchmediaattention
on television shows or following a high-profile death.
While forensic pathologists are responsible for determining whether the cause of someone’s death was natural,
a suicide, accidental, or a homicide, there are times when uncovering the cause of death is more complex, and
other skills are needed. Forensic anthropology brings the tools and knowledge of physical anthropology and human
osteology (the study of the skeleton) to the task of investigating a death. A forensic anthropologist assists medical
andlegalprofessionalsinidentifyinghumanremains.Thesciencebehindforensicanthropologyinvolvesthestudyof

Metatarsal Bones
The anterior half of the foot is formed by the five metatarsal bones, which are located between the tarsal bones of the
posterior foot and the phalanges of the toes (see Figure 8.19). These elongated bones are numbered 1–5, starting with
the medial side of the foot. The first metatarsal bone is shorter and thicker than the others. The second metatarsal is the
longest. The base of the metatarsal bone is the proximal end of each metatarsal bone. These articulate with the cuboid
or cuneiform bones. The base of the fifth metatarsal has a large, lateral expansion that provides for muscle attachments.

provided by the calcaneus bone and anteriorly by the heads (distal ends) of the metatarsal bones. The talus bone, which

Limb Growth
Each upper and lower limb initially develops as a small bulge called a limb bud, which appears on the lateral side of
the early embryo. The upper limb bud appears near the end of the fourth week of development, with the lower limb bud
appearing shortly after (Figure 8.20).

Ossification of Appendicular Bones
Allofthegirdleandlimbbones,exceptfortheclavicle,developbytheprocessofendochondralossification.Thisprocess
begins as the mesenchyme within the limb bud differentiates into hyaline cartilage to form cartilage models for future
bones. By the twelfth week, a primary ossification center will have appeared in the diaphysis (shaft) region of the long
bones,initiatingtheprocessthatconvertsthecartilagemodelintobone.Asecondaryossificationcenterwillappearineach

manyyears,untilthebonereachesitsfinal,adultsize,atwhichtimetheepiphysealplatedisappearsandtheepiphysisfuses
to the diaphysis. (Seek additional content on ossification in the chapter on bone tissue.)
Small bones, such as the phalanges, will develop only one secondary ossification center and will thus have only a single
epiphyseal plate. Large bones, such as the femur, will develop several secondary ossification centers, with an epiphyseal
plateassociatedwitheachsecondarycenter.Thus,ossificationofthefemurbeginsattheendoftheseventhweekwiththe

At birth, children with a clubfoot have the heel turned inward and the anterior foot twisted so that the lateral side
of the foot is facing inferiorly, commonly due to ligaments or leg muscles attached to the foot that are shortened or
abnormallytight.Thesepullthefootintoanabnormalposition,resultinginbonedeformities.Othersymptomsmay

this is not a painful condition for newborns. However, it must be treated early to avoid future pain and impaired
walking ability.
Althoughthecauseofclubfootisidiopathic(unknown),evidenceindicatesthatfetalpositionwithintheuterusisnot
a contributing factor. Genetic factors are involved, because clubfoot tends to run within families. Cigarette smoking
during pregnancy has been linked to the development of clubfoot, particularly in families with a history of clubfoot.
Previously, clubfoot required extensive surgery. Today, 90 percent of cases are successfully treated without surgery
using new corrective casting techniques. The best chance for a full recovery requires that clubfoot treatment begin
duringthefirst2weeksafterbirth.Correctivecastinggentlystretchesthefoot,whichisfollowedbytheapplicationof

8.3The Pelvic Girdle and Pelvis
The pelvic girdle, consisting of a hip bone, serves to attach a lower limb to the axial skeleton. The hip bone articulates
posteriorlyatthesacroiliacjointwiththesacrum,whichispartoftheaxialskeleton.Therightandlefthipbonesconverge
anteriorly and articulate with each other at the pubic symphysis. The combination of the hip bone, the sacrum, and the
coccyxformsthepelvis.Thepelvishasapronouncedanteriortilt.Theprimaryfunctionofthepelvisistosupporttheupper
body and transfer body weight to the lower limbs. It also serves as the site of attachment for multiple muscles.
Thehipboneconsistsofthreeregions:theilium,ischium,andpubis.Theiliumformsthelarge,fan-likeregionofthehip
bone. The superior margin of this area is the iliac crest. Located at either end of the iliac crest are the anterior superior
andposteriorsuperioriliacspines.Inferiortothesearetheanteriorinferiorandposteriorinferioriliacspines.Theauricular
surface of the ilium articulates with the sacrum to form the sacroiliac joint. The medial surface of the upper ilium forms
theiliacfossa,withthearcuatelinemarkingtheinferiorlimitofthisarea.Theposteriormarginoftheiliumhasthelarge

Thepubisformstheanteriorportionofthehipbone.Thebodyofthepubisarticulateswiththepubisoftheoppositehip
bone at the pubic symphysis. The superior margin of the pubic body has the pubic tubercle. The pubis is joined to the
iliumbythesuperiorpubicramus,thesuperiorsurfaceofwhichformsthepectinealline.Theinferiorpubicramusprojects

joined to the hip bone by the sacrospinous ligament, which attaches to the ischial spine, and the sacrotuberous ligament,
which attaches to the ischial tuberosity. The sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments contribute to the formation of the
greater and lesser sciatic foramina.

The leg contains the large tibia on the medial side and the slender fibula on the lateral side. The tibia bears the weight
ofthe body,whereas the fibula does not bear weight. The interosseous border ofeach bone is the attachment site forthe
interosseous membrane of the leg, the connective tissue sheet that unites the tibia and fibula.
The proximal tibia consists of the expanded medial and lateral condyles, which articulate with the medial and lateral
condyles of the femur to form the knee joint. Between the tibial condyles is the intercondylar eminence. On the anterior

The head of the fibula forms the proximal end and articulates with the underside of the lateral condyle of the tibia. The
distal fibula articulates with the fibular notch of the tibia. The expanded distal end of the fibula is the lateral malleolus.
The posterior foot is formed by the seven tarsal bones. The talus articulates superiorly with the distal tibia, the medial

limbs into their final positions.
Endochondral ossification, the process that converts the hyaline cartilage model into bone, begins in most appendicular
bones by the twelfth fetal week. This begins as a primary ossification center in the diaphysis, followed by the later
appearance of one or more secondary ossifications centers in the regions of the epiphyses. Each secondary ossification
center is separated from the primary ossification center by an epiphyseal plate. Continued growth of the epiphyseal
plate cartilage provides for bone lengthening. Disappearance of the epiphyseal plate is followed by fusion of the bony
components to form a single, adult bone.
The clavicle develops via intramembranous ossification, in which mesenchyme is converted directly into bone tissue.
Ossification within the clavicle begins during the fifth week of development and continues until 25 years of age.

• Describethecharacteristicfeaturesforfibrous,cartilaginous,andsynovialjointsandgiveexamplesofeach
• Define and identify the different body movements

334 CHAPTER 9 | JOINTS
The articulating surfaces of bones at stable types of joints, with little or no mobility, are strongly united to each other.
Forexample,mostofthejointsoftheskullareheldtogetherbyfibrousconnectivetissueanddonotallowformovement
betweentheadjacentbones.Thislackofmobilityisimportant,becausetheskullbonesservetoprotectthebrain.Similarly,
otherjointsunitedbyfibrousconnectivetissueallowforverylittlemovement,whichprovidesstabilityandweight-bearing
support for the body. For example, the tibia and fibula of the leg are tightly united to give stability to the body when
standing. At other joints, the bones are held together by cartilage, which permits limited movements between the bones.
Thus, the joints of the vertebral column only allow for small movements between adjacent vertebrae, but when added
together, these movements provide the flexibility that allows your body to twist, or bend to the front, back, or side. In
contrast, at joints that allow for wide ranges of motion, the articulating surfaces of the bones are not directly united to
eachother.Instead,thesesurfacesareenclosedwithinaspacefilledwithlubricatingfluid,whichallowsthebonestomove

Your ability to kick a soccer ball, pick up a fork, and dance the tango depend on mobility at these types of joints.
9.1 | Classification of Joints
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Distinguish between the functional and structural classifications for joints
• Describe the three functional types of joints and give an example of each
• List the three types of diarthrodial joints
A joint, also called an articulation, is any place where adjacent bones or bone and cartilage come together (articulate
witheachother)toformaconnection.Jointsareclassifiedbothstructurallyandfunctionally.Structuralclassificationsof
joints take into account whether the adjacent bones are strongly anchored to each other by fibrous connective tissue or
cartilage,orwhethertheadjacentbonesarticulatewitheachotherwithinafluid-filledspacecalledajointcavity.Functional
classifications describe thedegreeofmovement available between thebones,rangingfromimmobile, toslightly mobile,
tofreelymoveable joints.Theamountofmovement available ataparticular jointofthebodyisrelated tothefunctional
requirementsforthatjoint.Thusimmobileorslightlymoveablejointsservetoprotectinternalorgans,givestabilitytothe
body,andallowforlimitedbodymovement.Incontrast,freelymoveablejointsallowformuchmoreextensivemovements
of the body and limbs.
Structural Classification of Joints
The structural classification of joints is based on whether the articulating surfaces of the adjacent bones are directly
connectedbyfibrousconnectivetissueorcartilage,orwhetherthearticulatingsurfacescontacteachotherwithinafluid-
filled joint cavity. These differences serve to divide the joints of the body into three structural classifications. A fibrous
jointiswheretheadjacentbonesareunitedbyfibrousconnectivetissue.Atacartilaginousjoint,thebonesarejoinedby
hyalinecartilageorfibrocartilage.Atasynovialjoint,thearticulatingsurfacesofthebonesarenotdirectlyconnected,but
insteadcomeintocontactwitheachotherwithinajointcavitythatisfilledwithalubricatingfluid.Synovialjointsallow
for free movement between the bones and are the most common joints of the body.
Functional Classification of Joints
The functional classification of joints is determined by the amount of mobility found between the adjacent bones. Joints
are thus functionally classified as a synarthrosis or immobile joint, an amphiarthrosis or slightly moveable joint, or as a
diarthrosis,whichisafreelymoveablejoint(arthroun=“tofastenbyajoint”).Dependingontheirlocation,fibrousjoints
maybefunctionallyclassifiedasasynarthrosis(immobilejoint)oranamphiarthrosis(slightlymobilejoint).Cartilaginous
jointsarealsofunctionallyclassifiedaseitherasynarthrosisoranamphiarthrosisjoint.Allsynovialjointsarefunctionally
classified as a diarthrosis joint.
Synarthrosis
An immobile or nearly immobile joint is called a synarthrosis. The immobile nature of these joints provide for a strong

type of joint. Intervertebral discs are made of fibrocartilage and thereby structurally form a symphysis type of
cartilaginous joint.
Diarthrosis
A freely mobile joint is classified as a diarthrosis. These types of joints include all synovial joints of the body, which
providethemajorityofbodymovements.Mostdiarthroticjointsarefoundintheappendicularskeletonandthusgivethe

andsagittal.Thus,diarthrosesareclassifiedasuniaxial(formovementinoneplane),biaxial(formovementintwoplanes),
or multiaxial joints (for movement in all three anatomical planes).
A uniaxial joint only allows for a motion in a single plane (around a single axis). The elbow joint, which only allows
forbending orstraightening, is anexample ofauniaxial joint. Abiaxial joint allows formotions within two planes. An

Intheforearm,thewidegapbetweentheshaftportionsoftheradiusandulnabonesarestronglyunitedbyaninterosseous
membrane (see Figure 9.5b). Similarly, in the leg, the shafts of the tibia and fibula are also united by an interosseous
membrane. In addition, at the distal tibiofibular joint, the articulating surfaces of the bones lack cartilage and the narrow
gapbetweenthebonesisanchoredbyfibrousconnectivetissueandligamentsonboththeanteriorandposterioraspectsof
the joint. Together, the interosseous membrane and these ligaments form the tibiofibular syndesmosis.
The syndesmoses found in the forearm and leg serve to unite parallel bones and prevent their separation. However, a
syndesmosisdoesnotpreventallmovementbetweenthebones,andthusthistypeoffibrousjointisfunctionallyclassified
as an amphiarthrosis. In the leg, the syndesmosis between the tibia and fibula strongly unites the bones, allows for little
movement,andfirmlylocksthetalusboneinplacebetweenthetibiaandfibulaattheanklejoint.Thisprovidesstrength
andstabilitytothelegandankle,whichareimportantduringweightbearing.Intheforearm,theinterosseousmembrane
is flexible enough to allow for rotation of the radius bone during forearm movements. Thus in contrast to the stability
provided by the tibiofibular syndesmosis, the flexibility of the antebrachial interosseous membrane allows for the much
greater mobility of the forearm.
The interosseous membranes ofthe leg and forearm also provide areas formuscle attachment. Damage to a syndesmotic
joint, which usually results from a fracture of the bone with an accompanying tear of the interosseous membrane, will
produce pain, loss of stability of the bones, and may damage the muscles attached to the interosseous membrane. If the
fracture site is not properly immobilized with a cast or splint, contractile activity by these muscles can cause improper
alignment of the broken bones during healing.
Gomphosis
A gomphosis (“fastened with bolts”) is the specialized fibrous joint that anchors the root of a tooth into its bony socket
withinthemaxillarybone(upperjaw)ormandiblebone(lowerjaw)oftheskull.Agomphosisisalsoknownasapeg-and-
socket joint. Spanningbetween thebonywalls ofthesocket andtherootofthetootharenumerousshortbandsofdense

this type of joint is functionally classified as a synarthrosis.
9.3 | Cartilaginous Joints
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the structural features of cartilaginous joints
• Distinguish between a synchondrosis and symphysis
• Give an example of each type of cartilaginous joint
As the name indicates, at a cartilaginous joint, the adjacent bones are united by cartilage, a tough but flexible type of
connective tissue. These types of joints lack a joint cavity and involve bones that are joined together by either hyaline
cartilageorfibrocartilage(Figure9.7).Therearetwotypesofcartilaginousjoints.Asynchondrosisisacartilaginousjoint
where the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Also classified as a synchondrosis are places where bone is united to a

cartilaginous joint is a symphysis, where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage.

Structural Features of Synovial Joints
Synovial joints are characterized by the presence of a joint cavity. The walls of this space are formed by the articular
capsule,afibrousconnective tissue structure that isattached toeach bonejust outside the area ofthe bone’sarticulating
surface. The bones of the joint articulate with each other within the joint cavity.

Theabilityofthebonestomovesmoothlyagainsteachotherwithinthejointcavity,andthefreedomofjointmovement
this provides, means that each synovial joint is functionally classified as a diarthrosis.
Outside of their articulating surfaces, the bones are connected together by ligaments, which are strong bands of fibrous
connectivetissue.Thesestrengthenandsupportthejointbyanchoringthebonestogetherandpreventingtheirseparation.
Ligaments allow for normal movements at a joint, but limit the range of these motions, thus preventing excessive or

Types of Synovial Joints
Synovial joints are subdivided based on the shapes of the articulating surfaces of the bones that form each joint. The six
types of synovial joints are pivot, hinge, condyloid, saddle, plane, and ball-and socket-joints (Figure 9.10).

their distinctive “opposable” thumbs. The sternoclavicular joint is also classified as a saddle joint.
Plane Joint
At a plane joint (gliding joint), the articulating surfaces of the bones are flat or slightly curved and of approximately
the same size, which allows the bones to slide against each other (see Figure 9.10d). The motion at this type of joint is
usuallysmallandtightlyconstrainedbysurroundingligaments.Basedonlyontheirshape,planejointscanallowmultiple
movements, including rotation. Thus plane joints can be functionally classified as a multiaxial joint. However, not all of
these movements are available to every plane joint due to limitations placed on it by ligaments or neighboring bones.
Thus,dependinguponthespecificjointofthebody,aplanejointmayexhibitonlyasingletypeofmovementorseveral
movements. Plane joints are found between the carpal bones (intercarpal joints) of the wrist or tarsal bones (intertarsal
joints)ofthefoot,betweentheclavicleandacromionofthescapula(acromioclavicularjoint),andbetweenthesuperiorand
inferior articular processes of adjacent vertebrae (zygapophysial joints).
Ball-and-Socket Joint
The joint with the greatest range of motion is the ball-and-socket joint. At these joints, the rounded head of one bone
(the ball) fits into the concave articulation (the socket) of the adjacent bone (see Figure 9.10f). The hip joint and the
glenohumeral (shoulder) joint are the only ball-and-socket joints of the body. At the hip joint, the head of the femur
articulates with the acetabulum of the hip bone, and at the shoulder joint, the head of the humerus articulates with the
glenoid cavity of the scapula.
Ball-and-socketjointsareclassifiedfunctionallyasmultiaxialjoints.Thefemurandthehumerusareabletomoveinboth

Joints
Arthritis is a common disorder of synovial joints that involves inflammation of the joint. This often results in
significant joint pain, along with swelling, stiffness, and reduced joint mobility. There are more than 100 different
formsofarthritis.Arthritismayarisefromaging,damagetothearticularcartilage,autoimmunediseases,bacterialor
viral infections, or unknown (probably genetic) causes.

As the articular cartilage layer wears down, more pressure is placed on the bones. The joint responds by increasing
production of the lubricating synovial fluid, but this can lead to swelling of the joint cavity, causing pain and joint
stiffnessasthearticularcapsuleisstretched.Thebonetissueunderlyingthedamagedarticularcartilagealsoresponds
by thickening, producing irregularities and causing the articulating surface of the bone to become rough or bumpy.
Jointmovementthenresultsinpainandinflammation.Initsearlystages,symptomsofosteoarthritismaybereduced
by mild activity that “warms up” the joint, but the symptoms may worsen following exercise. In individuals with
moreadvancedosteoarthritis,theaffectedjointscanbecomemorepainfulandthereforearedifficulttouseeffectively,
resulting in increased immobility. There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but several treatments can help alleviate the
pain.Treatmentsmayincludelifestylechanges,suchasweightlossandlow-impactexercise,andover-the-counteror
prescriptionmedicationsthathelptoalleviatethepainandinflammation.Forseverecases,jointreplacementsurgery
(arthroplasty) may be required.

produce arthritis because the immune system of the body attacks the body joints. In rheumatoid arthritis, the joint
capsule and synovial membrane become inflamed. As the disease progresses, the articular cartilage is severely
damaged or destroyed, resulting in joint deformation, loss of movement, and severe disability. The most commonly
involved joints are the hands, feet, and cervical spine, with corresponding joints on both sides of the body usually
affected, though not always to the same extent. Rheumatoid arthritis is also associated with lung fibrosis, vasculitis
(inflammationofbloodvessels),coronaryheartdisease,andprematuremortality.Withnoknowncure,treatmentsare

9.5 | Types of Body Movements
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define the different types of body movements
• Identify the joints that allow for these motions
Synovial joints allow the body a tremendous range of movements. Each movement at a synovial joint results from the
contraction or relaxation of the muscles that are attached to the bones on either side of the articulation. The type of
movementthatcanbeproducedatasynovialjointisdeterminedbyitsstructuraltype.Whiletheball-and-socketjointgives

the shoulder, hip, elbow, knee, wrist, metacarpophalangeal, metatarsophalangeal, and interphalangeal joints. (c)–(d)
Anterior bending of the head or vertebral column is flexion, while any posterior-going movement is extension. (e)
Abduction and adduction are motions of the limbs, hand, fingers, or toes in the coronal (medial–lateral) plane of
movement. Moving the limb or hand laterally away from the body, or spreading the fingers or toes, is abduction.
Adduction brings the limb or hand toward or across the midline of the body, or brings the fingers or toes together.
Circumduction is the movement of the limb, hand, or fingers in a circular pattern, using the sequential combination
of flexion, adduction, extension, and abduction motions. Adduction/abduction and circumduction take place at the
shoulder, hip, wrist, metacarpophalangeal, and metatarsophalangeal joints. (f) Turning of the head side to side or
twisting of the body is rotation. Medial and lateral rotation of the upper limb at the shoulder or lower limb at the hip
involves turning the anterior surface of the limb toward the midline of the body (medial or internal rotation) or away
from the midline (lateral or external rotation).

Protraction and Retraction
Protractionandretractionareanterior-posteriormovementsofthescapulaormandible.Protractionofthescapulaoccurs
when the shoulder is moved forward, as when pushing against something or throwing a ball. Retraction is the opposite
motion,withthescapulabeingpulledposteriorlyandmedially,towardthevertebralcolumn.Forthemandible,protraction
occurs when the lower jaw is pushed forward, to stick out the chin, while retraction pulls the lower jaw backward. (See
Figure 9.13j.)
Depression and Elevation

Excursion
Excursion isthe side toside movement ofthe mandible. Lateral excursion moves the mandible away fromthe midline,
toward either the right or left side.Medial excursionreturns the mandible to its resting position at the midline.
Superior Rotation and Inferior Rotation
Superiorandinferiorrotationaremovementsofthescapulaandaredefinedbythedirectionofmovementoftheglenoid

combinationsofmusclesactingonthescapula.Duringsuperiorrotation,theglenoidcavitymovesupwardasthemedial
end of the scapular spine moves downward. This is a very important motion that contributes to upper limb abduction.
Without superior rotation of the scapula, the greater tubercle of the humerus would hit the acromion of the scapula, thus
preventing any abduction of the arm above shoulder height. Superior rotation of the scapula is thus required for full
abduction of the upper limb. Superior rotation is also used without arm abduction when carrying a heavy load with your
handoronyourshoulder.Youcanfeelthisrotationwhenyoupickupaload,suchasaheavybookbagandcarryitononly

Opposition and Reposition
Opposition is the thumb movement that brings the tip of the thumb in contact with the tip of a finger. This movement
is produced at the first carpometacarpal joint, which is a saddle joint formed between the trapezium carpal bone and the
firstmetacarpalbone.Thumboppositionisproducedbyacombinationofflexionandabductionofthethumbatthisjoint.
Returning the thumb to its anatomical position next to the index finger is calledreposition(seeFigure 9.13l).

9.6 | Anatomy of Selected Synovial Joints
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the bones that articulate together to form selected synovial joints
• Discuss the movements available at each joint
• Describe the structures that support and prevent excess movements at each joint
Each synovial joint of the body is specialized to perform certain movements. The movements that are allowed are
determined by the structural classification for each joint. For example, a multiaxial ball-and-socket joint has much more
mobilitythanauniaxialhingejoint.However,theligamentsandmusclesthatsupportajointmayplacerestrictionsonthe
total range of motion available. Thus, the ball-and-socket joint of the shoulder has little in the way of ligament support,
which gives the shoulder a very large range of motion. In contrast, movements at the hip joint are restricted by strong
ligaments, which reduce its range of motion but confer stability during standing and weight bearing.
Thissectionwillexaminetheanatomyofselectedsynovialjointsofthebody.Anatomicalnamesformostjointsarederived
fromthenamesofthebonesthatarticulateatthatjoint,althoughsomejoints,suchastheelbow,hip,andkneejointsare
exceptions to this general naming scheme.

Inadditiontobeingheldtogetherbytheintervertebraldiscs,adjacentvertebraealsoarticulatewitheachotheratsynovial
jointsformedbetweenthesuperiorandinferiorarticularprocessescalledzygapophysialjoints(facetjoints)(seeFigure
9.3). These are plane joints that provide for only limited motions between the vertebrae. The orientation of the articular
processes at these joints varies in different regions of the vertebral column and serves to determine the types of motions
available in each vertebral region. The cervical and lumbar regions have the greatest ranges of motions.
In the neck, the articular processes of cervical vertebrae are flattened and generally face upward or downward. This
orientation provides the cervical vertebral column with extensive ranges of motion for flexion, extension, lateral flexion,
androtation.Inthethoracicregion,thedownwardprojectingandoverlappingspinousprocesses,alongwiththeattached
thoraciccage,greatlylimitflexion,extension,andlateralflexion.However,theflattenedandverticallypositionedthoracic
articular processes allow for the greatest range of rotation within the vertebral column. The lumbar region allows for
considerable extension, flexion, and lateral flexion, but the orientation of the articular processes largely prohibits rotation.
Thearticulationsformedbetweentheskull,theatlas(C1vertebra),andtheaxis(C2vertebra)differfromthearticulations
in other vertebral areas and play important roles in movement of the head. The atlanto-occipital joint is formed by the

Temporomandibular Joint
Thetemporomandibularjoint(TMJ)isthejointthatallowsforopening(mandibulardepression)andclosing(mandibular
elevation) of the mouth, as well as side-to-side and protraction/retraction motions of the lower jaw. This joint involves
the articulation between the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal bone, with the condyle (head) of the
mandible.Locatedbetweenthesebonystructures,fillingthegapbetweentheskullandmandible,isaflexiblearticulardisc
(Figure 9.15). This disc serves to smooth the movements between the temporal bone and mandibular condyle.
MovementattheTMJduringopeningandclosingofthemouthinvolvesbothglidingandhingemotionsofthemandible.
Withthemouthclosed,themandibularcondyleandarticulardiscarelocatedwithinthemandibularfossaofthetemporal
bone. During opening of the mouth, the mandible hinges downward and at the same time is pulled anteriorly, causing
both the condyle and the articular disc to glide forward from the mandibular fossa onto the downward projecting
articular tubercle. The net result is a forward and downward motion of the condyle and mandibular depression. The
temporomandibularjointissupportedbyanextrinsicligamentthatanchorsthemandibletotheskull.Thisligamentspans
the distance between the base of the skull and the lingula on the medial side of the mandibular ramus.
Dislocation of the TMJ may occur when opening the mouth too wide (such as when taking a large bite) or following a
blow to the jaw, resulting in the mandibular condyle moving beyond (anterior to) the articular tubercle. In this case, the

Theacetabulum isthesocketportionofthehipjoint.Thisspaceisdeepandhasalargearticulation areaforthefemoral
head, thus giving stability and weight bearing ability to the joint. The acetabulum is further deepened by the acetabular
labrum, a fibrocartilage lip attached to the outer margin of the acetabulum. The surrounding articular capsule is strong,
with several thickened areas forming intrinsic ligaments. These ligaments arise from the hip bone, at the margins of the
acetabulum, and attach to the femur at the base of the neck. The ligaments are the iliofemoral ligament, pubofemoral
ligament, and ischiofemoral ligament, all of which spiral around the head and neck of the femur. The ligaments are
tightened by extension at the hip, thus pulling the head of the femur tightly into the acetabulum when in the upright,
standing position. Very little additional extension of the thigh is permitted beyond this vertical position. These ligaments

9.7 | Development of Joints
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the two processes by which mesenchyme can give rise to bone
• Discuss the process by which joints of the limbs are formed
Joints form during embryonic development in conjunction with the formation and growth of the associated bones. The
embryonic tissue that gives rise to all bones, cartilages, and connective tissues of the body is called mesenchyme. In the
head,mesenchymewillaccumulateatthoseareasthatwillbecomethebonesthatformthetopandsidesoftheskull.The
mesenchymeintheseareaswilldevelopdirectlyintobonethroughtheprocessofintramembranousossification,inwhich
mesenchymal cells differentiate into bone-producing cells that then generate bone tissue. The mesenchyme between the
areas of bone production will become the fibrous connective tissue that fills the spaces between the developing bones.

CHAPTER REVIEW
9.1Classification of Joints
Structuralclassificationsofthebodyjointsarebasedonhowthebonesareheldtogetherandarticulatewitheachother.At
fibrousjoints,theadjacentbonesaredirectlyunitedtoeachotherbyfibrousconnectivetissue.Similarly,atacartilaginous
joint,theadjacentbonesareunitedbycartilage.Incontrast,atasynovialjoint,thearticulatingbonesurfacesarenotdirectly
united to each other, but come together within a fluid-filled joint cavity.
The functional classification of body joints is based on the degree of movement found at each joint. A synarthrosis is a
joint that is essentially immobile. This type of joint provides for a strong connection between the adjacent bones, which
servestoprotectinternalstructuressuchasthebrainorheart.Examplesincludethefibrousjointsoftheskullsuturesand
thecartilaginousmanubriosternaljoint.Ajointthatallowsforlimitedmovementisanamphiarthrosis.Anexampleisthe

cartilaginousjointsinwhichvertebraeareunitedbyintervertebraldiscsprovideforsmallmovementsbetweentheadjacent
vertebraeandarealsoanamphiarthrosistypeofjoint.Thus,basedontheirmovementability,bothfibrousandcartilaginous
joints are functionally classified as a synarthrosis or amphiarthrosis.
The most common type of joint is the diarthrosis, which is a freely moveable joint. All synovial joints are functionally
classifiedasdiarthroses.Auniaxialdiarthrosis,suchastheelbow,isajointthatonlyallowsformovementwithinasingle

9.3Cartilaginous Joints
There are two types of cartilaginous joints. A synchondrosis is formed when the adjacent bones are united by hyaline
cartilage. A temporary synchondrosis is formed by the epiphyseal plate of a growing long bone, which is lost when the
epiphyseal plate ossifies as the bone reaches maturity. The synchondrosis is thus replaced by a synostosis. Permanent
synchondrosesthatdonotossifyarefoundatthefirststernocostaljointandbetweentheanteriorendsofthebonyribsand

Synovialjointsarethemostcommontypeofjointsinthebody.Theyarecharacterized bythepresence ofajointcavity,
insideofwhichthebonesofthejointarticulatewitheachother.Thearticulatingsurfacesofthebonesatasynovialjoint
are not directly connected to each other by connective tissue or cartilage, which allows the bones to move freely against
eachother.Thewallsofthejointcavityareformedbythearticularcapsule.Frictionbetweenthebonesisreducedbyathin
layerofarticularcartilagecoveringthesurfacesofthebones,andbyalubricatingsynovialfluid,whichissecretedbythe
synovial membrane.
Synovial joints are strengthened by the presence of ligaments, which hold the bones together and resist excessive or
abnormalmovementsofthejoint.Ligamentsareclassifiedasextrinsicligamentsiftheyarelocatedoutsideofthearticular
capsule,intrinsicligamentsiftheyarefusedtothewallofthearticularcapsule,orintracapsularligamentsiftheyarelocated
insidethearticularcapsule.Somesynovialjointsalsohaveanarticulardisc(meniscus),whichcanprovidepaddingbetween
thebones,smooththeirmovements,orstronglyjointhebonestogethertostrengthenthejoint.Musclesandtheirtendons
acting across a joint can also increase their contractile strength when needed, thus providing indirect support for the joint.
Bursae contain a lubricating fluid that serves to reduce friction between structures. Subcutaneous bursae prevent friction
between the skin and an underlying bone, submuscular bursae protect muscles from rubbing against a bone or another
muscle,andasubtendinousbursapreventsfrictionbetweenboneandamuscletendon.Tendonsheathscontainalubricating
fluid and surround tendons to allow for smooth movement of the tendon as it crosses a joint.
Basedontheshapeofthearticulatingbonesurfacesandthetypesofmovementallowed,synovialjointsareclassifiedinto
sixtypes.Atapivotjoint,oneboneisheldwithinaringbyaligamentanditsarticulationwithasecondbone.Pivotjoints
onlyallowforrotationaroundasingleaxis.ThesearefoundatthearticulationbetweentheC1(atlas)andthedensofthe
C2 (axis) vertebrae, which provides the side-to-side rotation of the head, or at the proximal radioulnar joint between the
headoftheradiusandtheradialnotchoftheulna,whichallowsforrotationoftheradiusduringforearmmovements.Hinge
joints,suchasattheelbow,knee,ankle,orinterphalangealjointsbetweenphalanxbonesofthefingersandtoes,allowonly
for bending and straightening of the joint. Pivot and hinge joints are functionally classified as uniaxial joints.
Condyloidjointsarefoundwheretheshallowdepressionofonebonereceivesaroundedbonyareaformedbyoneortwo

Atasaddlejoint,thearticulatingbonesfittogetherlikeariderandasaddle.Anexampleisthefirstcarpometacarpaljoint
located at the base of the thumb. Both condyloid and saddle joints are functionally classified as biaxial joints.
Plane joints are formed between the small, flattened surfaces of adjacent bones. These joints allow the bones to slide or
rotateagainsteachother,buttherangeofmotionisusuallyslightandtightlylimitedbyligamentsorsurroundingbones.
This type of joint is found between the articular processes of adjacent vertebrae, at the acromioclavicular joint, or at the
intercarpaljointsofthehandandintertarsaljointsofthefoot.Ball-and-socketjoints,inwhichtheroundedheadofabone
fits into a large depression or socket, are found at the shoulder and hip joints. Both plane and ball-and-sockets joints are
classifiedfunctionallyasmultiaxialjoints.However,ball-and-socketjointsallowforlargemovements,whilethemotions

9.6Anatomy of Selected Synovial Joints
Although synovial joints share many common features, each joint of the body is specialized for certain movements and
activities.Thejointsoftheupperlimbprovideforlargerangesofmotion,whichgivetheupperlimbgreatmobility,thus

them greater strength and the stability needed to support the body weight during running, jumping, or kicking activities.
Thejointsofthevertebralcolumnincludethesymphysisjointsformedbyeachintervertebraldiscandtheplanesynovial
jointsbetween thesuperiorandinferiorarticular processesofadjacent vertebrae. Eachofthesejointsprovideforlimited
motions, but these sum together to produce flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation of the neck and body. The
rangeofmotionsavailableineachregionofthevertebralcolumnvaries,withallofthesemotionsavailableinthecervical
region. Only rotation is allowed in the thoracic region, while the lumbar region has considerable extension, flexion, and
lateralflexion,butrotationisprevented.Theatlanto-occipitaljointallowsforflexionandextensionofthehead,whilethe
atlantoaxial joint is a pivot joint that provides for rotation of the head.

side motions of the lower jaw.
Theglenohumeral(shoulder)jointisamultiaxialball-and-socketjointthatprovidesflexion/extension,abduction/adduction,
circumduction, and medial/lateral rotation of the humerus. The head of the humerus articulates with the glenoid cavity
of the scapula. The glenoid labrum extends around the margin of the glenoid cavity. Intrinsic ligaments, including the
coracohumeral ligament andglenohumeral ligaments, provide some supportforthe shoulder joint. However,the primary
support comes from muscles crossing the joint whose tendons form the rotator cuff. These muscle tendons are protected
from friction against the scapula by the subacromial bursa and subscapular bursa.
Theelbowisauniaxialhingejointthatallowsforflexion/extensionoftheforearm.Itincludesthehumeroulnarjointand
the humeroradial joint. The medial elbow is supported by the ulnar collateral ligament and the radial collateral ligament
supports the lateral side. These ligaments prevent side-to-side movements and resist hyperextension of the elbow. The

Theacetabulumisdeepenedbytheacetabularlabrum.Theiliofemoral,pubofemoral,andischiofemoralligamentsstrongly
support the hip joint in the upright, standing position. The ligament of the head of the femur provides little support but
carries an important artery that supplies the femur.
The knee includes three articulations. The femoropatellar joint is between the patella and distal femur. The patella, a
sesamoid bone incorporated into the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle of the anterior thigh, serves to protect this
tendonfromrubbingagainstthedistalfemurduringkneemovements.Themedialandlateraltibiofemoraljoints,between
the condyles of the femur and condyles of the tibia, are modified hinge joints that allow for knee extension and flexion.

The talocrural joint forms the ankle. It consists of the articulation between the talus bone and the medial malleolus of
the tibia, the distal end of the tibia, and the lateral malleolus of the fibula. This is a uniaxial hinge joint that allows only
dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the foot. Gliding motions at the subtalar and intertarsal joints of the foot allow for

9.7Development of Joints
During embryonic growth, bones and joints develop from mesenchyme, an embryonic tissue that gives rise to bone,
cartilage, and fibrous connective tissues. In the skull, the bones develop either directly from mesenchyme through the
process of intramembranous ossification, or indirectly through endochondral ossification, which initially forms a hyaline
cartilage model of the future bone, which is later converted into bone. In both cases, the mesenchyme between the
developingbonesdifferentiatesintofibrousconnectivetissuethatwillunitetheskullbonesatsuturejoints.Inthelimbs,
mesenchymeaccumulationswithinthegrowinglimbbudwillbecomeahyalinecartilagemodelforeachofthelimbbones.
A joint interzone will develop between these areas of cartilage. Mesenchyme cells at the margins of the interzone will
give rise to the articular capsule, while cell death at the center forms the space that will become the joint cavity of the

Introduction
Chapter Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Explain the organization of muscle tissue
• Describe the function and structure of skeletal, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle
• Explain how muscles work with tendons to move the body
• Describe how muscles contract and relax
• Define the process of muscle metabolism
• Explain how the nervous system controls muscle tension
• Relate the connections between exercise and muscle performance
• Explain the development and regeneration of muscle tissue
Whenmostpeoplethinkofmuscles,theythinkofthemusclesthatarevisiblejustundertheskin,particularlyofthelimbs.
These are skeletal muscles, so-named because most of them move the skeleton. But there are two other types of muscle
in the body, with distinctly different jobs. Cardiac muscle, found in the heart, is concerned with pumping blood through
thecirculatorysystem.Smoothmuscleisconcernedwithvariousinvoluntarymovements,suchashavingone’shairstand

function of these three types of muscles.
382 CHAPTER 10 | MUSCLE TISSUE
10.1 | Overview of Muscle Tissues
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the different types of muscle
• Explain contractibility and extensibility
Muscle is one of the four primary tissue types of the body, and the body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal
muscle,cardiacmuscle,andsmoothmuscle(Figure10.2).Allthreemuscletissueshavesomepropertiesincommon;they
all exhibit a quality called excitability as their plasma membranes can change their electrical states (from polarized to
depolarized) and send an electrical wave called an action potential along the entire length of the membrane. While the
nervous system can influence the excitability of cardiac and smooth muscle to some degree, skeletal muscle completely
dependsonsignalingfromthenervoussystemtoworkproperly.Ontheotherhand,bothcardiacmuscleandsmoothmuscle
can respond to other stimuli, such as hormones and local stimuli.

contracting, and they all relax when the Ca++is removed and the actin-binding sites are re-shielded.
A muscle can return to its original length when relaxed due to a quality of muscle tissue called elasticity. It can recoil
backtoitsoriginallengthduetoelasticfibers.Muscletissuealsohasthequalityofextensibility;itcanstretchorextend.
Contractilityallows muscle tissue to pull on its attachment points and shorten with force.
Differences among the three muscle types include the microscopic organization of their contractile proteins—actin and
myosin. The actin and myosin proteins are arranged very regularly in the cytoplasm of individual muscle cells (referred
toasfibers)inbothskeletalmuscleandcardiacmuscle,whichcreatesapattern,orstripes,calledstriations.Thestriations
arevisiblewithalightmicroscopeunderhighmagnification(seeFigure10.2).Skeletalmusclefibersaremultinucleated
structures that compose the skeletal muscle. Cardiac muscle fibers each have one to two nuclei and are physically and
electrically connected to each other so that the entire heart contracts as one unit (called a syncytium).
Because the actin and myosin are not arranged in such regular fashion in smooth muscle, the cytoplasm of a smooth

Skeletal Muscle Fibers
Because skeletal muscle cells are long and cylindrical, they are commonly referred to as muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle

Some other terminology associated with muscle fibers is rooted in the Greek sarco, which means “flesh.” The plasma
membrane of muscle fibers is called the sarcolemma, the cytoplasm is referred to as sarcoplasm, and the specialized

The Sarcomere
The striated appearance of skeletal muscle fibers is due to the arrangement of the myofilaments of actin and myosin in
sequential order from one end of the muscle fiber to the other. Each packet of these microfilaments and their regulatory
proteins,troponinandtropomyosin(along with other proteins) is called asarcomere.

described in the video? (d) What gives a skeletal muscle fiber its striated appearance?
The sarcomere is the functional unit of the muscle fiber. The sarcomere itself is bundled within the myofibril that runs
the entire length of the muscle fiber and attaches to the sarcolemma at its end. As myofibrils contract, the entire muscle
cellcontracts.Becausemyofibrilsareonlyapproximately1.2μmindiameter,hundredstothousands(eachwiththousands
of sarcomeres) can be found inside one muscle fiber. Each sarcomere is approximately 2 μm in length with a three-
dimensional cylinder-like arrangement and is bordered by structures called Z-discs (also called Z-lines, because pictures

theneuromuscularjunction(NMJ).Thisiswherethemusclefiberfirstrespondstosignalingbythemotorneuron.Every
skeletal muscle fiber in every skeletal muscle is innervated by a motor neuron at the NMJ. Excitation signals from the

Excitation-Contraction Coupling
All living cells have membrane potentials, or electrical gradients across their membranes. The inside of the membrane
is usually around -60 to -90 mV, relative to the outside. This is referred to as a cell’s membrane potential. Neurons and

Althoughthetermexcitation-contractioncouplingconfusesorscaressomestudents,itcomesdowntothis:foraskeletal
muscle fiber to contract, its membrane must first be “excited”—in other words, it must be stimulated to fire an action
potential. The muscle fiber action potential, which sweeps along the sarcolemma as a wave, is “coupled” to the actual
contraction through the release ofcalcium ions (Ca++)from the SR. Once released, the Ca++ interacts with the shielding
proteins, forcing them to move aside so that the actin-binding sites are available for attachment by myosin heads. The
myosin then pulls the actin filaments toward the center, shortening the muscle fiber.
Inskeletalmuscle,thissequencebeginswithsignalsfromthesomaticmotordivisionofthenervoussystem.Inotherwords,
the “excitation” step in skeletal muscles is always triggered by signaling from the nervous system (Figure 10.6).

a channel in the ACh receptor opens and positively charged ions can pass through into the muscle fiber, causing it to

As the membrane depolarizes, another set of ion channels called voltage-gated sodium channels are triggered to open.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the components involved in a muscle contraction
• Explain how muscles contract and relax
• Describe the sliding filament model of muscle contraction
The sequence of events that result in the contraction of an individual muscle fiber begins with a signal—the
neurotransmitter, ACh—from the motor neuron innervating that fiber. The local membrane of the fiber will depolarize
as positively charged sodium ions (Na+) enter, triggering an action potential that spreads to the rest of the membrane

The region where thick and thin filaments overlap has a dense appearance, as there is little space between the filaments.
This zone where thin and thick filaments overlap is very important to muscle contraction, as it is the site where filament
movement starts. Thin filaments, anchored at their ends by the Z-discs, do not extend completely into the central region
392 CHAPTER 10 | MUSCLE TISSUE
that only contains thick filaments, anchored at their bases at a spot called the M-line. A myofibril is composed of many
sarcomeres running along its length; thus, myofibrils and muscle cells contract as the sarcomeres contract.
The Sliding Filament Model of Contraction
Whensignaledbyamotorneuron,askeletalmusclefibercontractsasthethinfilamentsarepulledandthenslidepastthe
thick filaments within the fiber’s sarcomeres. This process is known as the sliding filament model of muscle contraction
(Figure 10.10). The sliding can only occur when myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments are exposed by a series of
steps that begins with Ca++entry into the sarcoplasm.

Sources of ATP
ATP supplies the energy for muscle contraction to take place. In addition to its direct role in the cross-bridge cycle,
ATP also provides the energy for the active-transport Ca++ pumps in the SR. Muscle contraction does not occur without
sufficientamountsofATP.TheamountofATPstoredinmuscleisverylow,onlysufficienttopowerafewsecondsworth
of contractions. As it is broken down, ATP must therefore be regenerated and replaced quickly to allow for sustained
contraction. There are three mechanisms by which ATP can be regenerated: creatine phosphate metabolism, anaerobic

As the ATP produced by creatine phosphate is depleted, muscles turn to glycolysis as an ATP source. Glycolysis is an

If oxygen is available, pyruvic acid is used in aerobic respiration. However, if oxygen is not available, pyruvic acid is
converted to lactic acid, which may contribute to muscle fatigue. This conversion allows the recycling of the enzyme

Aerobic respiration is the breakdown of glucose or other nutrients in the presence of oxygen (O2) to produce carbon
dioxide,water,andATP.Approximately95percentoftheATPrequiredforrestingormoderatelyactivemusclesisprovided
by aerobic respiration, which takes place in mitochondria. The inputs for aerobic respiration include glucose circulating
in the bloodstream, pyruvic acid, and fatty acids. Aerobic respiration is much more efficient than anaerobic glycolysis,
producingapproximately36ATPspermoleculeofglucoseversusfourfromglycolysis.However,aerobicrespirationcannot

Muscle fatigue occurs when a muscle can no longer contract in response to signals from the nervous system. The exact
causes of muscle fatigue are not fully known, although certain factors have been correlated with the decreased muscle
contraction that occurs during fatigue. ATP is needed for normal muscle contraction, and as ATP reserves are reduced,
muscle function may decline. This may be more of a factor in brief, intense muscle output rather than sustained, lower
intensityefforts.LacticacidbuildupmaylowerintracellularpH,affectingenzymeandproteinactivity.ImbalancesinNa+
and K+ levels as a result of membrane depolarization may disrupt Ca++ flow out of the SR. Long periods of sustained

also require oxygen, and all of these combined processes result in the increased breathing rate that occurs after exercise.
Until the oxygen debt has been met, oxygen intake is elevated, even after exercise has stopped.
Relaxation of a Skeletal Muscle
Relaxing skeletal muscle fibers, and ultimately, the skeletal muscle, begins with the motor neuron, which stops releasing
itschemicalsignal,ACh,intothesynapseattheNMJ.Themusclefiberwillrepolarize,whichclosesthegatesintheSR

the“reshielding”oftheactin-bindingsitesonthethinfilaments.Withouttheabilitytoformcross-bridgesbetweenthethin
and thick filaments, the muscle fiber loses its tension and relaxes.
Muscle Strength
The number of skeletal muscle fibers in a given muscle is genetically determined and does not change. Muscle strength
is directly related to the amount of myofibrils and sarcomeres within each fiber. Factors, such as hormones and stress
(andartificialanabolicsteroids),actingonthemusclecanincreasetheproductionofsarcomeresandmyofibrilswithinthe
muscle fibers, a change called hypertrophy, which results in the increased mass and bulk in a skeletal muscle. Likewise,

boost the muscle’s production of utrophin, a protein similar to dystrophin that may be able to assume the role of
dystrophin and prevent cellular damage from occurring.

type. The tension produced by a single twitch can be measured by a myogram, an instrument that measures the amount
of tension produced over time (Figure 10.15). Each twitch undergoes three phases. The first phase is the latent period,

varying amounts of force; this is called a graded muscle response. The frequency of action potentials (nerve impulses)
from a motor neuron and the number of motor neurons transmitting action potentials both affect the tension produced in
skeletal muscle.
The rate at which a motor neuron fires action potentials affects the tension produced in the skeletal muscle. If the fibers
are stimulated while a previous twitch is still occurring, the second twitch will be stronger. This response is called wave
summation,becausetheexcitation-contractioncouplingeffectsofsuccessivemotorneuronsignalingissummed,oradded
together (Figure 10.16a). At the molecular level, summation occurs because the second stimulus triggers the release of
more Ca++ ions, which become available to activate additional sarcomeres while the muscle is still contracting from the
first stimulus. Summation results in greater contraction of the motor unit.

Treppe
Whenaskeletalmusclehasbeendormantforanextendedperiodandthenactivatedtocontract,withallotherthingsbeing

graded manner that to some looks like a set of stairs. This tension increase is called treppe, a condition where muscle
contractions become more efficient. It’s also known as the “staircase effect” (Figure 10.17).

10.5 | Types of Muscle Fibers
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the types of skeletal muscle fibers
• Explain fast and slow muscle fibers
Two criteria to consider when classifying the types of muscle fibers are how fast some fibers contract relative to others,
andhowfibersproduceATP.Usingthesecriteria,therearethreemaintypesofskeletalmusclefibers.Slowoxidative(SO)
fibers contract relatively slowly and use aerobic respiration (oxygen and glucose) to produce ATP. Fast oxidative (FO)
fibers have fast contractions and primarily use aerobic respiration, but because they may switch to anaerobic respiration
(glycolysis), can fatigue more quickly than SO fibers. Lastly, fast glycolytic (FG) fibers have fast contractions and
primarilyuseanaerobicglycolysis.TheFGfibersfatiguemorequicklythantheothers.Mostskeletalmusclesinahuman
contain(s) all three types, although in varying proportions.
The speed of contraction is dependent on how quickly myosin’s ATPase hydrolyzes ATP to produce cross-bridge action.
Fast fibers hydrolyze ATP approximately twice as quickly as slow fibers, resulting in much quicker cross-bridge cycling
(whichpullsthethinfilamentstowardthecenterofthesarcomeresatafasterrate).Theprimarymetabolicpathwayused
by a muscle fiber determines whether the fiber is classified as oxidative or glycolytic. If a fiber primarily produces ATP
throughaerobicpathwaysitisoxidative.MoreATPcanbeproducedduringeachmetaboliccycle,makingthefibermore
resistanttofatigue.GlycolyticfibersprimarilycreateATPthroughanaerobicglycolysis,whichproduceslessATPpercycle.
As a result, glycolytic fibers fatigue at a quicker rate.
Theoxidativefiberscontainmanymoremitochondriathantheglycolyticfibers,becauseaerobicmetabolism,whichuses
oxygen(O2)inthemetabolicpathway,occursinthemitochondria.TheSOfiberspossessalargenumberofmitochondria
and are capable of contracting for longer periods because of the large amount of ATP they can produce, but they have
a relatively small diameter and do not produce a large amount of tension. SO fibers are extensively supplied with blood
capillariestosupplyO2fromtheredbloodcellsinthebloodstream.TheSOfibersalsopossessmyoglobin,anO2-carrying

FG fibers primarily use anaerobic glycolysis as their ATP source. They have a large diameter and possess high amounts
of glycogen, which is used in glycolysis to generate ATP quickly to produce high levels of tension. Because they do

a mixture of each fiber type. The predominant fiber type in a muscle is determined by the primary function of the muscle.

Endurance Exercise
Slowfibers are predominantly usedinendurance exercises that require little force butinvolve numerous repetitions. The
aerobicmetabolismusedbyslow-twitchfibersallowsthemtomaintaincontractionsoverlongperiods.Endurancetraining
modifies these slow fibers to make them even more efficient by producing more mitochondria to enable more aerobic
metabolismandmoreATPproduction.Enduranceexercisecanalsoincreasetheamountofmyoglobininacell,asincreased
aerobic respiration increases the need for oxygen. Myoglobin is found in the sarcoplasm and acts as an oxygen storage
supply for the mitochondria.
Thetrainingcantriggertheformationofmoreextensivecapillarynetworksaroundthefiber,aprocesscalledangiogenesis,

muscle mass does not greatly increase in order to maintain a smaller area for the diffusion of nutrients and gases. All of
thesecellularchangesresultintheabilitytosustainlowlevelsofmusclecontractionsforgreaterperiodswithoutfatiguing.
The proportion of SO muscle fibers in muscle determines the suitability of that muscle for endurance, and may benefit
those participating inendurance activities. Postural muscles have alargenumber ofSOfibers andrelatively fewFOand

Exceptforthehypertrophythatfollowsanincrease inthenumberofsarcomeres andmyofibrilsinaskeletal muscle,the
cellular changes observed during endurance training do not usually occur with resistance training. There is usually no
significant increase in mitochondria or capillary density. However, resistance training does increase the development of

skeletal muscles can also lead to tendon damage and even skeletal damage if the load is too great for the muscles to bear.
Performance-Enhancing Substances
Someathletesattempttoboosttheirperformancebyusingvariousagentsthatmayenhancemuscleperformance.Anabolic
steroidsareoneofthemorewidelyknownagentsusedtoboostmusclemassandincreasepoweroutput.Anabolicsteroids
are a form of testosterone, a male sex hormone that stimulates muscle formation, leading to increased muscle mass.
Endurance athletes may also try to boost the availability of oxygen to muscles to increase aerobic respiration by using
substances such as erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone normally produced in the kidneys, which triggers the production of
redbloodcells.Theextraoxygencarriedbythesebloodcellscanthenbeusedbymusclesforaerobicrespiration.Human
growth hormone (hGH) is another supplement, and although it can facilitate building muscle mass, its main role is to
promotethehealingofmuscleandothertissuesafterstrenuousexercise.IncreasedhGHmayallowforfasterrecoveryafter
muscle damage, reducing the rest required after exercise, and allowing for more sustained high-level performance.

Aging and Muscle Tissue

age.Thisdeclineisnoticeable inathleteswhosesportsrequirestrengthandpowerfulmovements,suchassprinting,

As muscles age, muscle fibers die, and they are replaced by connective tissue and adipose tissue (Figure 10.20).
Becausethosetissuescannotcontractandgenerateforceasmusclecan,muscleslosetheabilitytoproducepowerful
contractions. The decline in muscle mass causes a loss of strength, including the strength required for posture and
mobility. This may be caused by a reduction in FG fibers that hydrolyze ATP quickly to produce short, powerful
contractions. Muscles in older people sometimes possess greater numbers of SO fibers, which are responsible for
longercontractionsanddonotproducepowerfulmovements.Theremayalsobeareductioninthesizeofmotorunits,
resulting in fewer fibers being stimulated and less muscle tension being produced.

10.7 | Cardiac Muscle Tissue
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe intercalated discs and gap junctions
• Describe a desmosome
Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart. Highly coordinated contractions of cardiac muscle pump blood into the
vessels of the circulatory system. Similar to skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated and organized into sarcomeres,
possessing the same banding organization as skeletal muscle (Figure 10.21). However, cardiac muscle fibers are shorter

explore the tissue sample in greater detail.
Intercalated discs are part of the sarcolemma and contain two structures important in cardiac muscle contraction: gap
junctions and desmosomes. A gap junction forms channels between adjacent cardiac muscle fibers that allow the
depolarizing current produced by cations to flow from one cardiac muscle cell to the next. This joining is called electric
coupling, and in cardiac muscle it allows the quick transmission of action potentials and the coordinated contraction of
theentireheart.Thisnetworkofelectricallyconnectedcardiacmusclecellscreatesafunctionalunitofcontractioncalled
a syncytium. The remainder of the intercalated disc is composed of desmosomes. A desmosome is a cell structure that
anchors the ends of cardiac muscle fibers together so the cells do not pull apart during the stress of individual fibers
contracting (Figure 10.22).

Another feature of cardiac muscle is its relatively long action potentials in its fibers, having a sustained depolarization

musclefibers.Thissustaineddepolarization(andCa++entry)providesforalongercontractionthanisproducedbyanaction

muscles comes from outside the cell rather than from the SR.

sample in greater detail.
Smooth muscle fibers are spindle-shaped (wide in the middle and tapered at both ends, somewhat like a football) and
have a single nucleus; they range from about 30 to 200 μm (thousands of times shorter than skeletal muscle fibers), and
they produce their own connective tissue, endomysium. Although they do not have striations and sarcomeres, smooth
musclefibersdohaveactinandmyosincontractileproteins,andthickandthinfilaments.Thesethinfilamentsareanchored
by dense bodies. A dense body is analogous to the Z-discs of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers and is fastened to the
sarcolemma. Calcium ions are supplied by the SR in the fibers and by sequestration from the extracellular fluid through
membrane indentations called calveoli.

Figure 10.24 Muscle Contraction The dense bodies and intermediate filaments are networked through the
sarcoplasm, which cause the muscle fiber to contract.
Although smooth muscle contraction relies on the presence of Ca++ ions, smooth muscle fibers have a much smaller
diameterthanskeletalmusclecells.T-tubulesarenotrequiredtoreachtheinteriorofthecellandthereforenotnecessaryto

TheinfluxofextracellularCa++ions,whichdiffuseintothesarcoplasmtoreachthecalmodulin,accountsformostofthe
Ca++that triggers contraction of a smooth muscle cell.
Muscle contraction continues until ATP-dependent calcium pumps actively transport Ca++ ions back into the SR and out
ofthe cell. However,a low concentration ofcalcium remains in the sarcoplasm to maintain muscle tone. This remaining
calcium keeps the muscle slightly contracted, which is important in certain tracts and around blood vessels.
Because most smooth muscles must function for long periods without rest, their power output is relatively low, but
contractions can continue without using large amounts of energy. Some smooth muscle can also maintain contractions

and other visceral organs with very little energy expenditure.
Smooth muscle is not under voluntary control; thus, it is called involuntary muscle. The triggers for smooth muscle
contractionincludehormones,neuralstimulationbytheANS,andlocalfactors.Incertainlocations,suchasthewallsof
visceral organs, stretching the muscle can trigger its contraction (the stretch-relaxation response).
Axons of neurons in the ANS do not form the highly organized NMJs with smooth muscle, as seen between motor
neuronsandskeletalmusclefibers.Instead,thereisaseriesofneurotransmitter-filledbulgescalledvaricositiesasanaxon
coursesthroughsmoothmuscle,looselyformingmotorunits(Figure10.25).Avaricosityreleasesneurotransmittersinto
the synaptic cleft. Also, visceral muscle in the walls of the hollow organs (except the heart) contains pacesetter cells. A
pacesetter cellcan spontaneously trigger action potentials and contractions in the muscle.

Hyperplasia in Smooth Muscle
Similar to skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, smooth muscle can undergo hypertrophy to increase in size. Unlike other
muscle, smooth muscle can also divide to produce more cells, a process called hyperplasia. This can most evidently be
observedintheuterusatpuberty,whichrespondstoincreased estrogenlevels byproducingmoreuterine smoothmuscle
fibers, and greatly increases the size of the myometrium.
10.9 | Development and Regeneration of Muscle Tissue
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the function of satellite cells
• Define fibrosis
• Explain which muscle has the greatest regeneration ability
Most muscle tissue of the body arises from embryonic mesoderm. Paraxial mesodermal cells adjacent to the neural tube
form blocks of cells called somites. Skeletal muscles, excluding those of the head and limbs, develop from mesodermal
somites,whereasskeletalmuscleintheheadandlimbsdevelopfromgeneralmesoderm.Somitesgiverisetomyoblasts.A

10.2Skeletal Muscle
Skeletal muscles contain connective tissue, blood vessels, and nerves. There are three layers of connective tissue:
epimysium,perimysium,andendomysium.Skeletalmusclefibersareorganizedintogroupscalledfascicles.Bloodvessels
and nerves enter the connective tissue and branch in the cell. Muscles attach to bones directly or through tendons or
aponeuroses. Skeletal muscles maintain posture, stabilize bones and joints, control internal movement, and generate heat.
Skeletal muscle fibers are long, multinucleated cells. The membrane of the cell is the sarcolemma; the cytoplasm of the
cellisthesarcoplasm.Thesarcoplasmicreticulum(SR)isaformofendoplasmicreticulum.Musclefibersarecomposedof
myofibrils.Thestriationsarecreatedbytheorganizationofactinandmyosinresultinginthebandingpatternofmyofibrils.
10.3Muscle Fiber Contraction and Relaxation
A sarcomere is the smallest contractile portion of a muscle. Myofibrils are composed of thick and thin filaments. Thick
filamentsarecomposedoftheproteinmyosin;thinfilamentsarecomposedoftheproteinactin.Troponinandtropomyosin
are regulatory proteins.
Musclecontractionisdescribedbytheslidingfilamentmodelofcontraction.AChistheneurotransmitterthatbindsatthe

10.5Types of Muscle Fibers
ATP provides the energy for muscle contraction. The three mechanisms for ATP regeneration are creatine phosphate,
anaerobic glycolysis, and aerobic metabolism. Creatine phosphate provides about the first 15 seconds of ATP at the
beginningofmusclecontraction.AnaerobicglycolysisproducessmallamountsofATPintheabsenceofoxygenforashort
period. Aerobic metabolism utilizes oxygen to produce much more ATP, allowing a muscle to work for longer periods.
Musclefatigue,whichhasmanycontributingfactors,occurswhenmusclecannolongercontract.Anoxygendebtiscreated
asaresultofmuscleuse.Thethreetypesofmusclefiberareslowoxidative(SO),fastoxidative(FO)andfastglycolytic
(FG). SO fibers use aerobic metabolism to produce low power contractions over long periods and are slow to fatigue.
FO fibers use aerobic metabolism to produce ATP but produce higher tension contractions than SO fibers. FG fibers use
anaerobic metabolism to produce powerful, high-tension contractions but fatigue quickly.
10.6Exercise and Muscle Performance
Hypertrophyisanincreaseinmusclemassduetotheadditionofstructuralproteins.Theoppositeofhypertrophyisatrophy,
the loss of muscle mass due to the breakdown of structural proteins. Endurance exercise causes an increase in cellular
mitochondria,myoglobin,andcapillarynetworksinSOfibers.EnduranceathleteshaveahighlevelofSOfibersrelativeto

11.1 | Interactions of Skeletal Muscles, Their Fascicle
Arrangement, and Their Lever Systems
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Compare and contrast agonist and antagonist muscles
• Describe how fascicles are arranged within a skeletal muscle
• Explain the major events of a skeletal muscle contraction within a muscle in generating force
To move the skeleton, the tension created by the contraction of the fibers in most skeletal muscles is transferred to
the tendons. The tendons are strong bands of dense, regular connective tissue that connect muscles to bones. The bone
connection is why this muscle tissue is called skeletal muscle.
Interactions of Skeletal Muscles in the Body

forearmflexion—bending the elbow—the brachioradialis assists the brachialis.

Figure11.2PrimeMoversandSynergists Thebicepsbrachiiflexthelowerarm.Thebrachoradialis,intheforearm,
and brachialis, located deep to the biceps in the upper arm, are both synergists that aid in this motion.
A muscle with the opposite action of the prime mover is called an antagonist. Antagonists play two important roles in
musclefunction:(1)theymaintainbodyorlimbposition,suchasholdingthearmoutorstandingerect;and(2)theycontrol
rapid movement, as in shadow boxing without landing a punch or the ability to check the motion of a limb.
Forexample,toextendtheknee,agroupoffourmusclescalledthequadricepsfemorisintheanteriorcompartmentofthe
thigh are activated (and would be called the agonists of knee extension). However, to flex the knee joint, an opposite or
antagonistic set of muscles called the hamstrings is activated.

As you can see, these terms would also be reversed for the opposing action. If you consider the first action as the knee
bending,thehamstringswouldbecalledtheagonistsandthequadricepsfemoriswouldthenbecalledtheantagonists.See

There are also skeletal muscles that do not pull against the skeleton for movements. For example, there are the muscles
that produce facial expressions. The insertions and origins of facial muscles are in the skin, so that certain individual

When you first get up and start moving, your joints feel stiff for a number of reasons. After proper stretching and
warm-up, the synovial fluid may become less viscous, allowing for better joint function.
Patterns of Fascicle Organization
Skeletal muscle is enclosed in connective tissue scaffolding at three levels. Each muscle fiber (cell) is covered by

(oris = “oral”) refers to the oral cavity, or the mouth. The word oculi (ocular = “eye”) refers to the eye.
There are other muscles throughout the body named by their shape or location. The deltoid is a large, triangular-shaped
muscle that covers the shoulder. It is so-named because the Greek letter delta looks like a triangle. The rectus abdomis

11.2 | Naming Skeletal Muscles
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the criteria used to name skeletal muscles
• Explain how understanding the muscle names helps describe shapes, location, and actions of various muscles

subsequent societies studied Latin and Greek, and therefore the early pioneers of anatomy continued to apply Latin and

the location of its attachments to the skeleton, how many origins it has, or its action.
Theskeletalmuscle’sanatomicallocationoritsrelationshiptoaparticularboneoftendeterminesitsname.Forexample,
the frontalis muscle is located on top of the frontal bone of the skull. Similarly, the shapes of some muscles are very
distinctive and the names, such as orbicularis, reflect the shape. For the buttocks, the size of the muscles influences the
names: gluteus maximus (largest), gluteus medius (medium), and the gluteus minimus (smallest). Names were given to
indicate length— brevis (short), longus (long)—and to identify position relative to the midline: lateralis (to the outside
away from the midline), and medialis (toward the midline). The direction of the muscle fibers and fascicles are used to
describemusclesrelativetothemidline,suchastherectus(straight)abdominis,ortheoblique(atanangle)musclesofthe
abdomen.
Some muscle names indicate the number of muscles in a group. One example of this is the quadriceps, a group of four
muscles located on the anterior (front) thigh. Other muscle names can provide information as to how many origins a

• Identify the movement and function of the face, head, and neck muscles

is removed. It still takes about 30 minutes for a patient to wake up, and for breathing muscles to regain control of
respiration. After surgery, most people have a sore or scratchy throat for a few days.
Muscles of the Anterior Neck
The muscles of the anterior neck assist in deglutition (swallowing) and speech by controlling the positions of the larynx
(voice box), and the hyoid bone, a horseshoe-shaped bone that functions as a solid foundation on which the tongue can
move. The muscles of the neck are categorized according to their position relative to the hyoid bone (Figure 11.13).
Suprahyoid musclesare superior to it, and theinfrahyoid musclesare located inferiorly.
Figure11.13MusclesoftheAnteriorNeck Theanteriormusclesoftheneckfacilitateswallowingandspeech.The
suprahyoid muscles originate from above the hyoid bone in the chin region. The infrahyoid muscles originate below
the hyoid bone in the lower neck.
The suprahyoid muscles raise the hyoid bone, the floor of the mouth, and the larynx during deglutition. These include
the digastric muscle, which has anterior and posterior bellies that work to elevate the hyoid bone and larynx when one
swallows; it also depresses the mandible. The stylohyoid muscle moves the hyoidboneposteriorly,elevating the larynx,

Important in the stabilization of the vertebral column is the segmental muscle group, which includes the interspinales
and intertransversarii muscles. These muscles bring together the spinous and transverse processes of each consecutive
vertebra. Finally, the scalene muscles work together to flex, laterally flex, and rotate the head. They also contribute to
deep inhalation. The scalene muscles include the anterior scalene muscle (anterior to the middle scalene), the middle
scalenemuscle(thelongest,intermediate betweentheanteriorandposteriorscalenes), andtheposteriorscalenemuscle
(the smallest, posterior to the middle scalene).

Muscles of the Abdomen
There are four pairs of abdominal muscles that cover the anterior and lateral abdominal region and meet at the anterior
midline. These muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall can be divided into four groups: the external obliques, the
internal obliques, the transversus abdominis, and the rectus abdominis (Figure 11.16andTable 11.6).

The Diaphragm
The change in volume of the thoracic cavity during breathing is due to the alternate contraction and relaxation of the
diaphragm (Figure 11.17). It separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities, and is dome-shaped at rest. The superior
surface of the diaphragm is convex, creating the elevated floor of the thoracic cavity. The inferior surface is concave,
creating the curved roof of the abdominal cavity.
Figure 11.17Muscles of the Diaphragm The diaphragm separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities.
Defecating, urination, and even childbirth involve cooperation between the diaphragm and abdominal muscles (this

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify the muscles of the pectoral girdle and upper limbs
• Identify the movement and function of the pectoral girdle and upper limbs
Muscles of the shoulder and upper limb can be divided into four groups: muscles that stabilize and position the pectoral
girdle,musclesthatmovethearm,musclesthatmovetheforearm,andmusclesthatmovethewrists,hands,andfingers.
The pectoral girdle, or shoulder girdle, consists of the lateral ends of the clavicle and scapula, along with the proximal
end of the humerus, and the muscles covering these three bones to stabilize the shoulder joint. The girdle creates a base

originateonthepelvicgirdleandinsertintothefemur.Themusclesthatmovethelowerlegtypicallyoriginateonthe
femur and insert into the bones of the knee joint. The anterior muscles of the femur extend the lower leg but also
aid in flexing the thigh. The posterior muscles of the femur flex the lower leg but also aid in extending the thigh. A
combination of gluteal and thigh muscles also adduct, abduct, and rotate the thigh and lower leg.

Figure 11.30Gluteal Region Muscles That Move the Femur
The tensor fascia lata is a thick, squarish muscle in the superior aspect of the lateral thigh. It acts as a synergist of the
gluteus medius and iliopsoas in flexing and abducting the thigh. It also helps stabilize the lateral aspect of the knee by
pulling on the iliotibial tract (band), making it taut. Deep to the gluteus maximus, the piriformis, obturator internus,
obturator externus,superior gemellus,inferior gemellus, andquadratus femorislaterally rotate the femur at the hip.

11.2Naming Skeletal Muscles
Muscle names are based on many characteristics. The location of a muscle in the body is important. Some muscles are
named based on their size and location, such as the gluteal muscles of the buttocks. Other muscle names can indicate
the location in the body or bones with which the muscle is associated, such as the tibialis anterior. The shapes of some
musclesaredistinctive;forexample,thedirectionofthemusclefibersisusedtodescribemusclesofthebodymidline.The
originand/orinsertioncanalsobefeaturesusedtonameamuscle;examplesarethebicepsbrachii,tricepsbrachii,andthe
pectoralis major.
11.3Axial Muscles of the Head, Neck, and Back
Muscles are either axial muscles or appendicular. The axial muscles are grouped based on location, function, or both.
Someaxialmusclescrossovertotheappendicularskeleton.Themusclesoftheheadandneckareallaxial.Themuscles
in the face create facial expression by inserting into the skin rather than onto bone. Muscles that move the eyeballs are

head. The sternocleidomastoid divides the neck into anterior and posterior triangles.
The muscles of the back and neck that move the vertebral column are complex, overlapping, and can be divided into
five groups. The splenius group includes the splenius capitis and the splenius cervicis. The erector spinae has three
subgroups.Theiliocostalisgroupincludestheiliocostaliscervicis,theiliocostalisthoracis,andtheiliocostalislumborum.
Thelongissimusgroupincludesthelongissimuscapitis,thelongissimuscervicis,andthelongissimusthoracis.Thespinalis
group includes the spinalis capitis, the spinalis cervicis, and the spinalis thoracis. The transversospinales include the
semispinaliscapitis,semispinaliscervicis,semispinalisthoracis,multifidus,androtatores.Thesegmentalmusclesinclude
the interspinales and intertransversarii. Finally, the scalenes include the anterior scalene, middle scalene, and posterior

Made of skin, fascia, and four pairs of muscle, the anterior abdominal wall protects the organs located in the abdomen
andmovesthevertebralcolumn.Thesemusclesincludetherectusabdominis,whichextendsthroughtheentirelengthof
the trunk, the external oblique, the internal oblique, and the transversus abdominus. The quadratus lumborum forms the
posterior abdominal wall.
The muscles of the thorax play a large role in breathing, especially the dome-shaped diaphragm. When it contracts and

the rib cage and the volume-pressure ratio inside the pleural cavities during inspiration and expiration.
The perineum muscles play roles in urination in both sexes, ejaculation in men, and vaginal contraction in women. The
pelvic floor muscles support the pelvic organs, resist intra-abdominal pressure, and work as sphincters for the urethra,
rectum, and vagina.

12.1 | Basic Structure and Function of the Nervous
System
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify the anatomical and functional divisions of the nervous system
• Relate the functional and structural differences between gray matter and white matter structures of the nervous
system to the structure of neurons
• List the basic functions of the nervous system

the cranium, and the spinal cord, the extension of nervous tissue within the vertebral column. That suggests it is made
of two organs—and you may not even think of the spinal cord as an organ—but the nervous system is a very complex

The Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems
Thenervoussystemcanbedividedintotwomajorregions:thecentralandperipheralnervoussystems.Thecentralnervous
system (CNS) is the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is everything else (Figure 12.2).
The brain is contained within the cranial cavity of the skull, and the spinal cord is contained within the vertebral cavity
of the vertebral column. It is a bit of an oversimplification to say that the CNS is what is inside these two cavities and

There are two ways to consider how the nervous system is divided functionally. First, the basic functions of the nervous

Basic Functions
The nervous system is involved in receiving information about the environment around us (sensation) and generating
responses to that information (motor responses). The nervous system can be divided into regions that are responsible
for sensation (sensory functions) and for the response (motor functions). But there is a third function that needs to be
included.Sensoryinputneedstobeintegratedwithothersensations,aswellaswithmemories,emotionalstate,orlearning
(cognition). Some regions of the nervous system are termed integration or association areas. The process of integration
combines sensory perceptions and higher cognitive functions such as memories, learning, and emotion to produce a
response.
Sensation. The first major function of the nervous system is sensation—receiving information about the environment to
gaininputaboutwhatishappeningoutsidethebody(or,sometimes,withinthebody).Thesensoryfunctionsofthenervous

Responses can be divided into those that are voluntary or conscious (contraction of skeletal muscle) and those that are
involuntary (contraction of smooth muscles, regulation of cardiac muscle, activation of glands). Voluntary responses are
governedbythesomaticnervoussystemandinvoluntaryresponsesaregovernedbytheautonomicnervoussystem,which

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for involuntary control of the body, usually for the sake of
homeostasis(regulationoftheinternalenvironment).Sensoryinputforautonomicfunctionscanbefromsensorystructures
tuned to external or internal environmental stimuli. The motor output extends to smooth and cardiac muscle as well as
glandular tissue. The role of the autonomic system is to regulate the organ systems of the body, which usually means to

Neurons
Neurons are the cells considered to be the basis of nervous tissue. They are responsible for the electrical signals that

dimensional shape of these cells makes the immense numbers of connections within the nervous system possible.
Parts of a Neuron
As you learned in the first section, the main part of a neuron is the cell body, which is also known as the soma (soma =
“body”).Thecellbodycontainsthenucleusandmostofthemajororganelles.Butwhatmakesneuronsspecialisthatthey
havemanyextensionsoftheircellmembranes,whicharegenerallyreferredtoasprocesses.Neuronsareusuallydescribed
ashavingone,andonlyone,axon—afiberthatemergesfromthecellbodyandprojectstotargetcells.Thatsingleaxon
can branch repeatedly to communicate with many target cells. It is the axon that propagates the nerve impulse, which is
communicatedtooneormorecells.Theotherprocessesoftheneuronaredendrites,whichreceiveinformationfromother
neurons at specialized areas of contact called synapses. The dendrites are usually highly branched processes, providing
locations for other neurons to communicate with the cell body. Information flows through a neuron from the dendrites,
across the cell body, and down the axon. This gives the neuron a polarity—meaning that information flows in this one
direction.Figure 12.8shows the relationship of these parts to one another.
Figure 12.8Parts of a Neuron The major parts of the neuron are labeled on a multipolar neuron from the CNS.

is important to the way that electrical signals travel down the axon. The length of the axon between each gap, which is
wrappedinmyelin,isreferredtoasanaxonsegment.Attheendoftheaxonistheaxonterminal,wherethereareusually

Glial Cells
Glial cells, or neuroglia or simply glia, are the other type of cell found in nervous tissue. They are considered to be
supportingcells,andmanyfunctionsaredirectedathelpingneuronscompletetheirfunctionforcommunication.Thename
glia comes from the Greek word that means “glue,” and was coined by the German pathologist Rudolph Virchow, who
wrotein1856:“Thisconnectivesubstance,whichisinthebrain,thespinalcord,andthespecialsensenerves,isakindof
glue(neuroglia)inwhichthenervouselementsareplanted.”Today,researchintonervoustissuehasshownthatthereare
many deeper roles that these cells play. And research may find much more about them in the future.
There are six types of glial cells. Four of them are found in the CNS and two are found in the PNS. Table 12.2 outlines
some common characteristics and functions.

covering the CNS that is called the pia mater (Figure 12.11). Generally, they are supporting cells for the neurons in the
central nervous system. Some ways in which they support neurons in the central nervous system are by maintaining the
concentration of chemicals in the extracellular space, removing excess signaling molecules, reacting to tissue damage,
and contributing to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The blood-brain barrier is a physiological barrier that keeps many
substancesthatcirculateintherestofthebodyfromgettingintothecentralnervoussystem,restrictingwhatcancrossfrom

The second type of glial cell is the Schwann cell, which insulate axons with myelin in the periphery. Schwann cells are
different than oligodendrocytes, in that a Schwann cell wraps around a portion of only one axon segment and no others.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one such disease. It is an example of an autoimmune disease. The antibodies produced
by lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) mark myelin as something that should not be in the body. This causes
inflammation and the destruction of the myelin in the central nervous system. As the insulation around the axons is

Found in the skin of your fingers or toes is a type of sensory receptor that is sensitive to temperature, called a
thermoreceptor.Whenyouplaceyourhandundertheshower(Figure12.15),thecellmembraneofthethermoreceptors
changesitselectricalstate(voltage).Theamountofchangeisdependentonthestrengthofthestimulus(howhotthewater
is). This is called a graded potential. If the stimulus is strong, the voltage of the cell membrane will change enough to
generate an electrical signal that will travel down the axon. You have learned about this type of signaling before, with
respect to the interaction of nerves and muscles at the neuromuscular junction. The voltage at which such a signal is
generated is called the threshold, and the resulting electrical signal is called an action potential. In this example, the
actionpotentialtravels—aprocessknownaspropagation—alongtheaxonfromtheaxonhillocktotheaxonterminalsand

12.4 | The Action Potential
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the components of the membrane that establish the resting membrane potential
• Describe the changes that occur to the membrane that result in the action potential
The functions of the nervous system—sensation, integration, and response—depend on the functions of the neurons
underlying these pathways. To understand how neurons are able to communicate, it is necessary to describe the role
of an excitable membrane in generating these signals. The basis of this communication is the action potential, which
demonstrateshowchangesinthemembranecanconstituteasignal.Lookingatthewaythesesignalsworkinmorevariable
circumstances involves a look at graded potentials, which will be covered in the next section.
Electrically Active Cell Membranes
Most cells in the body make use of charged particles, ions, to build up a charge across the cell membrane. Previously,
this was shown to be a part of how muscle cells work. For skeletal muscles to contract, based on excitation–contraction
coupling,requiresinputfromaneuron.Bothofthecellsmakeuseofthecellmembranetoregulateionmovementbetween
the extracellular fluid and cytosol.
As you learned in the chapter on cells, the cell membrane is primarily responsible for regulating what can cross the
membraneandwhatstaysononlyoneside.Thecellmembraneisaphospholipidbilayer,soonlysubstancesthatcanpass
directlythroughthehydrophobiccorecandiffusethroughunaided.Chargedparticles,whicharehydrophilicbydefinition,
cannot pass through the cell membrane without assistance (Figure 12.17). Transmembrane proteins, specifically channel
proteins,makethispossible.Severalpassivetransportchannels,aswellasactivetransportpumps,arenecessarytogenerate
a transmembrane potential and an action potential. Of special interest is the carrier protein referred to as the sodium/
492 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE
potassium pump that moves sodium ions (Na+) out of a cell and potassium ions (K+) into a cell, thus regulating ion
concentration on both sides of the cell membrane.
Figure 12.17 Cell Membrane and Transmembrane Proteins The cell membrane is composed of a phospholipid
bilayerandhasmanytransmembraneproteins,includingdifferenttypesofchannelproteinsthatserveasionchannels.
The sodium/potassium pump requires energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), so it is also referred to as
an ATPase. As was explained in the cell chapter, the concentration of Na+ is higher outside the cell than inside, and
the concentration of K+ is higher inside the cell than outside. That means that this pump is moving the ions against the
concentration gradientsforsodiumandpotassium,whichiswhyitrequiresenergy.Infact,thepumpbasicallymaintains
those concentration gradients.
Ionchannelsareporesthatallowspecificchargedparticlestocrossthemembraneinresponsetoanexistingconcentration
gradient. Proteins are capable of spanning the cell membrane, including its hydrophobic core, and can interact with the
charge of ions because of the varied properties of amino acids found within specific domains or regions of the protein

A ligand-gated channel opens because a signaling molecule, a ligand, binds to the extracellular region of the channel.
Thistypeofchannelisalsoknownasanionotropicreceptorbecausewhentheligand,knownasaneurotransmitterinthe
nervous system, binds to the protein, ions cross the membrane changing its charge (Figure 12.18).

A mechanically gated channel opens because of a physical distortion of the cell membrane. Many channels associated

meaning that the membrane voltage moves back toward the -70 mV value of the resting membrane potential.
496 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE
Repolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mV value that indicates the resting potential, but it actually
overshoots that value. Potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mV, so a period of
hyperpolarizationoccurswhiletheK+channelsareopen.ThoseK+channelsareslightlydelayedinclosing,accountingfor

Figure 12.23 Graph of Action Potential Plotting voltage measured across the cell membrane against time, the
action potential begins with depolarization, followed by repolarization, which goes past the resting potential into
hyperpolarization, and finally the membrane returns to rest.

static images or through text descriptions. View this animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/dynamic1) to learn

Thequestionis,now,whatinitiates theactionpotential? Thedescription aboveconveniently glossesoverthatpoint.But

The channels that start depolarizing the membrane because of a stimulus help the cell to depolarize from -70 mV to -55
mV.Oncethemembranereachesthatvoltage,thevoltage-gatedNa+channelsopen.Thisiswhatisknownasthethreshold.

number of channels to open and an action potential will be initiated.
Because of the threshold, the action potential can be likened to a digital event—it either happens or it does not. If the
threshold is not reached, then no action potential occurs. If depolarization reaches -55 mV, then the action potential
continues and runs all the way to +30 mV, at which K+ causes repolarization, including the hyperpolarizing overshoot.
Also,thosechangesarethesameforeveryactionpotential,whichmeansthatoncethethresholdisreached,theexactsame
thing happens. A stronger stimulus, which might depolarize the membrane well past threshold, will not make a “bigger”
action potential. Action potentials are“all ornone.”Either themembrane reaches thethreshold andeverything occurs as

Becausevoltage-gatedNa+channelsareinactivatedatthepeakofthedepolarization,theycannotbeopenedagainforabrief
time—the absolute refractory period. Because of this, depolarization spreading back toward previously opened channels
has no effect. The action potential must propagate toward the axon terminals; as a result, the polarity of the neuron is
maintained, as mentioned above.
Propagation, as described above, applies to unmyelinated axons. When myelination is present, the action potential
propagates differently. Sodium ions that enter the cell at the initial segment start to spread along the length of the axon

Graded Potentials
Local changes in the membrane potential are called graded potentials and are usually associated with the dendrites of
a neuron. The amount of change in the membrane potential is determined by the size of the stimulus that causes it.
In the example of testing the temperature of the shower, slightly warm water would only initiate a small change in a
thermoreceptor, whereas hot water would cause a large amount of change in the membrane potential.
Gradedpotentialscanbeoftwosorts,eithertheyaredepolarizingorhyperpolarizing(Figure12.25).Foramembraneatthe

Figure 12.25 Graded Potentials Graded potentials are temporary changes in the membrane voltage, the
characteristics of which depend on the size of the stimulus. Some types of stimuli cause depolarization of the
membrane,whereasotherscausehyperpolarization.Itdependsonthespecificionchannelsthatareactivatedinthe
cell membrane.
Types of Graded Potentials
For the unipolar cells of sensory neurons—both those with free nerve endings and those within encapsulations—graded
potentials develop in the dendrites that influence the generation of an action potential in the axon of the same cell. This
iscalledageneratorpotential.Forothersensoryreceptorcells,suchastastecellsorphotoreceptorsoftheretina,graded
potentialsintheirmembranesresultinthereleaseofneurotransmittersatsynapseswithsensoryneurons.Thisiscalleda
receptor potential.
A postsynaptic potential (PSP) is the graded potential in the dendrites of a neuron that is receiving synapses from
other cells. Postsynaptic potentials can be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing. Depolarization in a postsynaptic potential is
calledanexcitatorypostsynapticpotential(EPSP)becauseitcausesthemembranepotentialtomovetowardthreshold.
Hyperpolarization in a postsynaptic potential is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) because it causes the
membrane potential to move away from threshold.
Summation
All types of graded potentials will result in small changes of either depolarization or hyperpolarization in the voltage of
a membrane. These changes can lead to the neuron reaching threshold if the changes add together, or summate. The

502 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE
An example of a chemical synapse is the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) described in the chapter on muscle tissue. In
the nervous system, there are many more synapses that are essentially the same as the NMJ. All synapses have common
characteristics, which can be summarized in this list:
• presynaptic element
• neurotransmitter (packaged in vesicles)
• synaptic cleft
• receptor proteins
• postsynaptic element
• neurotransmitter elimination or re-uptake
For the NMJ, these characteristics are as follows: the presynaptic element is the motor neuron's axon terminals, the
neurotransmitterisacetylcholine,thesynapticcleftisthespacebetweenthecellswheretheneurotransmitterdiffuses,the

but they all contain the same characteristics.

derivativeofglutamate),andglycine(Gly).Theseaminoacidshaveanaminogroupandacarboxylgroupintheirchemical

Another class of neurotransmitter is the biogenic amine, a group of neurotransmitters that are enzymatically made from
aminoacids.Theyhaveaminogroupsinthem,butnolongerhavecarboxylgroupsandarethereforenolongerclassified
as amino acids. Serotonin is made from tryptophan. It is the basis of the serotonergic system, which has its own specific
receptors. Serotonin is transported back into the presynaptic cell for repackaging.
504 CHAPTER 12 | THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND NERVOUS TISSUE
Other biogenic amines are made from tyrosine, and include dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Dopamine
is part of its own system, the dopaminergic system, which has dopamine receptors. Dopamine is removed from the
synapsebytransportproteinsinthepresynapticcellmembrane.Norepinephrineandepinephrinebelongtotheadrenergic
neurotransmitter system. The two molecules are very similar and bind to the same receptors, which are referred to as
alphaandbetareceptors.Norepinephrineandepinephrinearealsotransportedbackintothepresynapticcell.Thechemical
epinephrine (epi- = “on”; “-nephrine” = kidney) is also known as adrenaline (renal = “kidney”), and norepinephrine is
sometimesreferredtoasnoradrenaline.Theadrenalglandproducesepinephrineandnorepinephrinetobereleasedintothe
blood stream as hormones.
A neuropeptide is a neurotransmitter molecule made up of chains of amino acids connected by peptide bonds. This is
whataproteinis,butthetermproteinimplies acertain lengthtothemolecule. Someneuropeptides arequiteshort,such
asmet-enkephalin,whichisfiveaminoacidslong.Othersarelong,suchasbeta-endorphin,whichis31aminoacidslong.
Neuropeptidesareoftenreleasedatsynapsesincombinationwithanotherneurotransmitter,andtheyoftenactashormones
in other systems of the body, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or substance P.
The effect of a neurotransmitter on the postsynaptic element is entirely dependent on the receptor protein. First, if
there is no receptor protein in the membrane of the postsynaptic element, then the neurotransmitter has no effect. The
depolarizingorhyperpolarizingeffectisalsodependentonthereceptor.Whenacetylcholinebindstothenicotinicreceptor,
thepostsynapticcellisdepolarized.ThisisbecausethereceptorisacationchannelandpositivelychargedNa+willrush
into the cell. However, when acetylcholine binds to the muscarinic receptor, of which there are several variants, it might
cause depolarization or hyperpolarization of the target cell.
Theaminoacidneurotransmitters, glutamate, glycine,andGABA,arealmostexclusivelyassociated withjustoneeffect.
Glutamate is considered an excitatory amino acid, but only because Glu receptors in the adult cause depolarization of
the postsynaptic cell. Glycine and GABA are considered inhibitory amino acids, again because their receptors cause
hyperpolarization.
The biogenic amines have mixed effects. For example, the dopamine receptors that are classified as D1 receptors are
excitatory whereas D2-type receptors are inhibitory. Biogenic amine receptors and neuropeptide receptors can have even
more complex effects because some may not directly affect the membrane potential, but rather have an effect on gene
transcription or other metabolic processes in the neuron. The characteristics of the various neurotransmitter systems
presented in this section are organized inTable 12.3.
Theimportantthingtorememberaboutneurotransmitters,andsignalingchemicalsingeneral,isthattheeffectisentirely
dependent on the receptor. Neurotransmitters bind to one of two classes of receptors at the cell surface, ionotropic
or metabotropic (Figure 12.28). Ionotropic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, such as the nicotinic receptor for
acetylcholine or the glycine receptor. A metabotropic receptor involves a complex of proteins that result in metabolic
changes within the cell. The receptor complex includes the transmembrane receptor protein, a G protein, and an effector
protein.Theneurotransmitter,referredtoasthefirstmessenger,bindstothereceptorproteinontheextracellularsurfaceof

that binds to the receptor. This intracellular mediator is called the second messenger.
Different receptors use different second messengers. Two common examples of second messengers are cyclic adenosine
monophosphate(cAMP)andinositoltriphosphate(IP3).Theenzymeadenylatecyclase(anexampleofaneffectorprotein)
makes cAMP, and phospholipase C is the enzyme that makes IP3. Second messengers, after they are produced by the

the nervous system can be divided into those regions that are responsible for sensation, those that are responsible for

Nervous tissue can also be described as gray matter and white matter on the basis of its appearance in unstained tissue.
ThesedescriptionsaremoreoftenusedintheCNS.Graymatteriswherenucleiarefoundandwhitematteriswheretracts
are found. In the PNS, ganglia are basically gray matter and nerves are white matter.
The nervous system can also be divided on the basis of how it controls the body. The somatic nervous system (SNS)
is responsible for functions that result in moving skeletal muscles. Any sensory or integrative functions that result in
the movement of skeletal muscle would be considered somatic. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for
functionsthataffectcardiacorsmoothmuscletissue,orthatcauseglandstoproducetheirsecretions.Autonomicfunctions
are distributed between central and peripheral regions of the nervous system. The sensations that lead to autonomic
functions can be the same sensations that are part of initiating somatic responses. Somatic and autonomic integrative
functions may overlap as well.
A special division of the nervous system is the enteric nervous system, which is responsible for controlling the digestive
organs. Parts of the autonomic nervous system overlap with the enteric nervous system. The enteric nervous system is
exclusively found in the periphery because it is the nervous tissue in the organs of the digestive system.
12.2Nervous Tissue
Nervoustissuecontainstwomajorcelltypes,neuronsandglialcells.Neuronsarethecellsresponsibleforcommunication
through electrical signals. Glial cells are supporting cells, maintaining the environment around the neurons.
Neurons are polarized cells, based on the flow of electrical signals along their membrane. Signals are received at the
dendrites,arepassedalongthecellbody,andpropagatealongtheaxontowardsthetarget,whichmaybeanotherneuron,
muscle tissue, or a gland. Many axons are insulated by a lipid-rich substance called myelin. Specific types of glial cells
provide this insulation.
Several types of glial cells are found in the nervous system, and they can be categorized by the anatomical division in

Ependymal cells are responsible for filtering the blood to produce cerebrospinal fluid, which is a circulatory fluid that
performs some of the functions of blood in the brain and spinal cord because of the BBB. In the PNS, satellite cells are
supporting cells for the neurons, and Schwann cells insulate peripheral axons.

absolutelynoactionpotentialscanbegenerated.Oncethatchannelhasreturnedtoitsrestingstate,anewactionpotential
is possible, but it must be started by a relatively stronger stimulus to overcome the K+leaving the cell.
The action potential travels down the axon as voltage-gated ion channels are opened by the spreading depolarization.
In unmyelinated axons, this happens in a continuous fashion because there are voltage-gated channels throughout the
membrane.Inmyelinatedaxons,propagationisdescribedassaltatorybecausevoltage-gatedchannelsareonlyfoundatthe
nodes ofRanvier and the electrical events seem to “jump” from one node to the next. Saltatory conduction is faster than
continuousconduction,meaningthatmyelinatedaxonspropagatetheirsignalsfaster.Thediameteroftheaxonalsomakes
a difference as ions diffusing within the cell have less resistance in a wider space.
12.5Communication Between Neurons
The basis of the electrical signal within a neuron is the action potential that propagates down the axon. For a neuron to
generateanactionpotential,itneedstoreceiveinputfromanothersource,eitheranotherneuronorasensorystimulus.That
inputwillresultinopeningionchannelsintheneuron,resultinginagradedpotentialbasedonthestrengthofthestimulus.
Gradedpotentialscanbedepolarizingorhyperpolarizingandcansummatetoaffecttheprobabilityoftheneuronreaching
threshold.
Graded potentials can be the result of sensory stimuli. If the sensory stimulus is received by the dendrites of a unipolar
sensoryneuron,suchasthesensoryneuronendingintheskin,thegradedpotentialiscalledageneratorpotentialbecause
it can directly generate the action potential in the initial segment of the axon. If the sensory stimulus is received by
a specialized sensory receptor cell, the graded potential is called a receptor potential. Graded potentials produced by
interactions between neurons at synapses are called postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). A depolarizing graded potential at a
synapse is called an excitatory PSP, and a hyperpolarizing graded potential at a synapse is called an inhibitory PSP.
Synapses are the contacts between neurons, which can either be chemical or electrical in nature. Chemical synapses are
far more common. At a chemical synapse, neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic element and diffuses across
thesynapticcleft.Theneurotransmitterbindstoareceptorproteinandcausesachangeinthepostsynapticmembrane(the
PSP). The neurotransmitter must be inactivated or removed from the synaptic cleft so that the stimulus is limited in time.
The particular characteristics of a synapse vary based on the neurotransmitter system produced by that neuron. The
cholinergic system isfoundat the neuromuscular junction andincertain places within the nervoussystem. Amino acids,
suchasglutamate,glycine,andgamma-aminobutyricacid(GABA)areusedasneurotransmitters.Otherneurotransmitters

Introduction
Chapter Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Relate the developmental processes of the embryonic nervous system to the adult structures
• Name the major regions of the adult nervous system
• Locate regions of the cerebral cortex on the basis of anatomical landmarks common to all human brains
• Describe the regions of the spinal cord in cross-section
• List the cranial nerves in order of anatomical location and provide the central and peripheral connections
• List the spinal nerves by vertebral region and by which nerve plexus each supplies
The nervous system is responsible for controlling much of the body, both through somatic (voluntary) and autonomic
(involuntary)functions.Thestructuresofthenervoussystemmustbedescribedindetailtounderstandhowmanyofthese

the nervous system, delving deep into what the central and peripheral structures are.
The place to start this study of the nervous system is the beginning of the individual human life, within the womb. The
embryonic development of the nervous system allows for a simple framework on which progressively more complicated
structures can be built. With this framework in place, a thorough investigation of the nervous system is possible.
13.1 | The Embryologic Perspective
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the growth and differentiation of the neural tube
• Relate the different stages of development to the adult structures of the central nervous system
• Explain the expansion of the ventricular system of the adult brain from the central canal of the neural tube
• Describe the connections of the diencephalon and cerebellum on the basis of patterns of embryonic development

Many structures that appear to be adjacent in the adult brain are not connected, and the connections that exist may seem
arbitrary. But there is an underlying order to the system that comes from how different parts develop. By following the
developmental pattern, it is possible to learn what the major regions of the nervous system are.

tissue,developsintotheintegumentarysystem(theskin)andthenervoussystem.Itisprobablynotdifficulttoseethatthe
outer tissue of the embryo becomes the outer covering of the body. But how is it responsible for the nervous system?
As the embryo develops, a portion of the ectoderm differentiates into a specialized region of neuroectoderm, which is
the precursor for the tissue of the nervous system. Molecular signals induce cells in this region to differentiate into the
neuroepithelium,forminganeuralplate.Thecellsthenbegintochangeshape,causingthetissuetobuckleandfoldinward

shape. Three vesicles form at the first stage, which are called primary vesicles. These vesicles are given names that are
basedonGreekwords,themainrootwordbeingenkephalon,whichmeans“brain” (en-=“inside”; kephalon=“head”).
The prefix to each generally corresponds to its position along the length of the developing nervous system.
The prosencephalon (pros- = “in front”) is the forward-most vesicle, and the term can be loosely translated to mean
forebrain.Themesencephalon(mes-=“middle”)isthenextvesicle,whichcanbecalledthemidbrain.Thethirdvesicle

translate into the English words forebrain and midbrain, there is not a word for “four-sided-figure-brain.” However, the
third vesicle can be called the hindbrain. One way of thinking about how the brain is arranged is to use these three
regions—forebrain,midbrain,andhindbrain—whicharebasedontheprimaryvesiclestageofdevelopment(Figure13.3a).
Secondary Vesicles
The brain continues to develop, and the vesicles differentiate further (see Figure 13.3b). The three primary vesicles
become five secondary vesicles. The prosencephalon enlarges into two new vesicles called the telencephalon and the
diencephalon.Thetelecephalonwillbecomethecerebrum.Thediencephalongivesrisetoseveraladultstructures;twothat

Spinal Cord Development
While the brain is developing from the anterior neural tube, the spinal cord is developing from the posterior neural tube.
However, its structure does not differ from the basic layout of the neural tube. It is a long, straight cord with a small,

Relating Embryonic Development to the Adult Brain
Embryonic development can help in understanding the structure of the adult brain because it establishes a framework
on which more complex structures can be built. First, the neural tube establishes the anterior–posterior dimension of the
nervoussystem,whichiscalledtheneuraxis.Theembryonicnervoussysteminmammalscanbesaidtohaveastandard

in an inferior position—the end of the spinal cord—and ends in an anterior position, the front of the cerebrum. If this is

In summary, the primary vesicles help to establish the basic regions of the nervous system: forebrain, midbrain, and
hindbrain. These divisions are useful in certain situations, but they are not equivalent regions. The midbrain is small
compared with the hindbrain and particularly the forebrain. The secondary vesicles go on to establish the major regions
of the adult nervous system that will be followed in this text. The telencephalon is the cerebrum, which is the major
portion of the human brain. The diencephalon continues to be referred to by this Greek name, because there is no better
term for it (dia- = “through”). The diencephalon is between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system and can be
describedastheregionthroughwhichallprojectionshavetopassbetweenthecerebrumandeverythingelse.Thebrainstem

closingoftheneuraltubeisimportantformorethanjusttheproperformationofthenervoussystem.Thesurrounding
tissues are dependent on the correct development of the tube. The connective tissues surrounding the CNS can be
involved as well.
There are three classes of this disorder: occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele (Figure 13.5). The first type,
spina bifida occulta, is the mildest because the vertebral bones do not fully surround the spinal cord, but the spinal
cord itself is not affected. No functional differences may be noticed, which is what the word occulta means; it is
hidden spina bifida. The other two types both involve the formation of a cyst—a fluid-filled sac of the connective
tissuesthatcoverthespinalcordcalledthemeninges.“Meningocele”meansthatthemeningesprotrudethroughthe
spinal column but nerves may not be involved and few symptoms are present, though complications may arise later
in life. “Myelomeningocele” means that the meninges protrude and spinal nerves are involved, and therefore severe
neurological symptoms can be present.
Often surgery to close the opening or to remove the cyst is necessary. The earlier that surgery can be performed,
the better the chances of controlling or limiting further damage or infection at the opening. For many children
with meningocele, surgery will alleviate the pain, although they may experience some functional loss. Because the
myelomeningocele formofspinabifidainvolvesmoreextensivedamagetothenervoustissue,neurologicaldamage

• Name the major regions of the adult brain
• Describetheconnectionsbetweenthecerebrumandbrainstemthroughthediencephalon,andfromthoseregions
into the spinal cord
• Recognize the complex connections within the subcortical structures of the basal nuclei
• Explain the arrangement of gray and white matter in the spinal cord
The brain and the spinal cord are the central nervous system, and they represent the main organs of the nervous system.
The spinal cord is a single structure, whereas the adult brain is described in terms of four major regions: the cerebrum,
thediencephalon,thebrainstem,andthecerebellum.Aperson’sconsciousexperiencesarebasedonneuralactivityinthe

on the integration of sensory and motor pathways in the spinal cord.
The Cerebrum
The iconic gray mantle of the human brain, which appears to make up most of the mass of the brain, is the cerebrum
(Figure 13.6). The wrinkled portion is the cerebral cortex, and the rest of the structure is beneath that outer covering.

Different regions of the cerebral cortex can be associated with particular functions, a concept known as localization of
function. In the early 1900s, a German neuroscientist named Korbinian Brodmann performed an extensive study of the

The Myth of Left Brain/Right Brain
There is a persistent myth that people are “right-brained” or “left-brained,” which is an oversimplification of an
important concept about the cerebral hemispheres. There is some lateralization of function, in which the left side of
the brain is devoted to language function and the right side is devoted to spatial and nonverbal reasoning. Whereas
thesefunctionsarepredominantlyassociatedwiththosesidesofthebrain,thereisnomonopolybyeithersideonthese
functions. Many pervasive functions, such as language, are distributed globally around the cerebrum.
Some of the support for this misconception has come from studies of split brains. A drastic way to deal with a rare
and devastating neurological condition (intractable epilepsy) is to separate the two hemispheres of the brain. After
sectioning the corpus callosum, a split-brained patient will have trouble producing verbal responses on the basis of
sensoryinformationprocessedontherightsideofthecerebrum,leadingtotheideathattheleftsideisresponsiblefor
language function.
However,therearewell-documentedcasesoflanguagefunctionslostfromdamagetotherightsideofthebrain.The
deficits seen in damage to the left side of the brain are classified as aphasia, a loss of speech function; damage on

The diencephalon is deep beneath the cerebrum and constitutes the walls of the third ventricle. The diencephalon can
be described as any region of the brain with “thalamus” in its name. The two major regions of the diencephalon are the

Figure 13.12The Brain Stem The brain stem comprises three regions: the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla.
Midbrain
One of the original regions of the embryonic brain, the midbrain is a small region between the thalamus and pons. It is
separated into the tectum and tegmentum, from the Latin words for roof and floor, respectively. The cerebral aqueduct
passes through the center of the midbrain, such that these regions are the roof and floor of that canal.
The tectum is composed of four bumps known as the colliculi (singular = colliculus), which means “little hill” in Latin.

the tegmentum contains the nuclei that receive and send information through the cranial nerves, as well as regions that
regulate important functions such as those of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

percent of the mass of the brain.
Figure 13.13 The Cerebellum The cerebellum is situated on the posterior surface of the brain stem. Descending
input from the cerebellum enters through the large white matter structure of the pons. Ascending input from the
periphery and spinal cord enters through the fibers of the inferior olive. Output goes to the midbrain, which sends a
descending signal to the spinal cord.
Descending fibers from the cerebrum have branches that connect to neurons in the pons. Those neurons project into the

Just as the gray matter is separated into horns, the white matter of the spinal cord is separated into columns. Ascending
tracts of nervous system fibers in these columns carry sensory information up to the brain, whereas descending tracts
carry motor commands from the brain. Looking at the spinal cord longitudinally, the columns extend along its length as

mostcommonwayofdoingthatisbyprovidingtheaminoacidL-DOPA,whichisaprecursortotheneurotransmitter
dopamine and can cross the blood-brain barrier. With levels of the precursor elevated, the remaining cells of the

will become less responsive to L-DOPA treatment as time progresses, and it can cause increased dopamine levels
elsewhere in the brain, which are associated with psychosis or schizophrenia.

13.3 | Circulation and the Central Nervous System
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the vessels that supply the CNS with blood
• Name the components of the ventricular system and the regions of the brain in which each is located
• Explain the production of cerebrospinal fluid and its flow through the ventricles
• Explain how a disruption in circulation would result in a stroke
The CNS is crucial to the operation of the body, and any compromise in the brain and spinal cord can lead to severe
difficulties.TheCNShasaprivilegedbloodsupply,assuggestedbytheblood-brainbarrier.Thefunctionofthetissuein

needs specialized structures for the maintenance of circulation. This begins with a unique arrangement of blood vessels
carryingfreshbloodintotheCNS.Beyondthesupplyofblood,theCNSfiltersthatbloodintocerebrospinalfluid(CSF),
which is then circulated through the cavities of the brain and spinal cord called ventricles.
Blood Supply to the Brain
AlackofoxygentotheCNScanbedevastating,andthecardiovascularsystemhasspecificregulatoryreflexestoensure
that the blood supply is not interrupted. There are multiple routes for blood to get into the CNS, with specializations to
protect that blood supply and to maximize the ability of the brain to get an uninterrupted perfusion.
Arterial Supply

The symptoms associated with meningitis can be fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, soreness of the

memory deficits, and other dementia-type symptoms). A serious risk of meningitis can be damage to peripheral
structures because of the nerves that pass through the meninges. Hearing loss is a common result of meningitis.
The primary test formeningitis isalumbar puncture. Aneedle inserted into the lumbar region ofthe spinal column
through the dura mater and arachnoid membrane into the subarachnoid space can be used to withdraw the fluid for
chemicaltesting.Fatalityoccursin5to40percentofchildrenand20to50percentofadultswithbacterialmeningitis.

The Ventricular System
Cerebrospinalfluid(CSF)circulatesthroughoutandaroundtheCNS.Inothertissues,waterandsmallmoleculesarefiltered
through capillaries as the major contributor to the interstitial fluid. In the brain, CSF is produced in special structures to

eventually emerge into the subarachnoid space where it will be reabsorbed into the blood.
The Ventricles
There are four ventricles within the brain, all of which developed from the original hollow space within the neural tube,
the central canal. The first two are named the lateral ventricles and are deep within the cerebrum. These ventricles are
connected to the third ventricle by two openings called the interventricular foramina. The third ventricle is the space
between the left and right sides of the diencephalon, which opens into the cerebral aqueduct that passes through the
midbrain.Theaqueductopensintothefourthventricle,whichisthespacebetweenthecerebellumandtheponsandupper

the midbrain). The fourth ventricle then narrows into the central canal of the spinal cord.
The ventricular system opens up to the subarachnoid space from the fourth ventricle. The single median aperture and
the pair of lateral apertures connect to the subarachnoid space so that CSF can flow through the ventricles and around
the outside of the CNS. Cerebrospinal fluid is produced within the ventricles by a type of specialized membrane called
a choroid plexus. Ependymal cells (one of the types of glial cells described in the introduction to the nervous system)
surround blood capillaries and filter the blood to make CSF. The fluid is a clear solution with a limited amount of the
constituents of blood. It is essentially water, small molecules, and electrolytes. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are dissolved
into the CSF, as they are in blood, and can diffuse between the fluid and the nervous tissue.

Nerves
Bundles of axons in the PNS are referred to as nerves. These structures in the periphery are different than the central
counterpart, called a tract. Nerves are composed of more than just nervous tissue. They have connective tissues invested
in their structure, as well as blood vessels supplying the tissues with nourishment. The outer surface of a nerve is a
surrounding layer of fibrous connective tissue called the epineurium. Within the nerve, axons are further bundled into

nerve is responsible for eye movements by controlling four of the extraocular muscles. It is also responsible for lifting
the upper eyelid when the eyes point up, and for pupillary constriction. The trochlear nerve and the abducens nerve

the ventral nerve root. The dorsal root ganglion for each nerve is an enlargement of the spinal nerve.
There are 31 spinal nerves, named for the level of the spinal cord at which each one emerges. There are eight pairs of
cervicalnervesdesignatedC1toC8,twelvethoracicnervesdesignatedT1toT12,fivepairsoflumbarnervesdesignated
L1toL5,fivepairsofsacralnervesdesignatedS1toS5,andonepairofcoccygealnerves.Thenervesarenumberedfrom

betweenthefirstandsecondcervicalvertebrae.ThesameoccursforC3toC7,butC8emergesbetweentheseventhcervical
vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra. For the thoracic and lumbar nerves, each one emerges between the vertebra that

length of that unique vertebra.
Spinal nerves extend outward from the vertebral column to enervate the periphery. The nerves in the periphery are not
straight continuations of the spinal nerves, but rather the reorganization of the axons in those nerves to follow different
courses. Axons from different spinal nerves will come together into a systemic nerve. This occurs at four places along
thelengthofthevertebralcolumn,eachidentifiedasanerveplexus,whereastheotherspinalnervesdirectlycorrespond
tonerves at their respective levels. Inthis instance, the wordplexus isusedtodescribe networks ofnerve fibers with no
associated cell bodies.
Ofthefournerveplexuses,twoarefoundatthecervicallevel,oneatthelumbarlevel,andoneatthesacrallevel(Figure
13.24). The cervical plexus is composed of axons from spinal nerves C1 through C5 and branches into nerves in the

Anosmia results in a loss of the enjoyment of food.
As the replacement of olfactory neurons declines with age, anosmia can set in. Without the sense of smell, many
sufferers complain of food tasting bland. Often, the only way to enjoy food is to add seasoning that can be sensed

The brain develops from this early tube structure and gives rise to specific regions of the adult brain. As the neural tube
grows and differentiates, it enlarges into three vesicles that correspond to the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain regions
oftheadultbrain.Laterindevelopment,twoofthesethreevesiclesdifferentiatefurther,resultinginfivevesicles.Those
five vesicles can be aligned with the four major regions of the adult brain. The cerebrum is formed directly from the

13.3Circulation and the Central Nervous System
The CNS has a privileged blood supply established by the blood-brain barrier. Establishing this barrier are anatomical
structures that help to protect and isolate the CNS. The arterial blood to the brain comes from the internal carotid and
vertebral arteries, which both contribute to the unique circle of Willis that provides constant perfusion of the brain even
ifoneofthebloodvesselsisblockedornarrowed.Thatbloodiseventuallyfilteredtomakeaseparatemedium,theCSF,
thatcirculates withinthespacesofthebrainandthenintothesurroundingspacedefinedbythemeninges,theprotective
covering of the brain and spinal cord.
The blood that nourishes the brain and spinal cord is behind the glial-cell–enforced blood-brain barrier, which limits the
exchangeofmaterialfrombloodvesselswiththeinterstitialfluidofthenervoustissue.Thus,metabolicwastesarecollected
incerebrospinalfluidthatcirculatesthroughtheCNS.Thisfluidisproducedbyfilteringbloodatthechoroidplexusesin

the privileged central nervous tissue.
Theblood,nowwiththereabsorbedCSF,drainsoutofthecraniumthroughtheduralsinuses.Theduramateristhetough
outer covering of the CNS, which is anchored to the inner surface of the cranial and vertebral cavities. It surrounds the
venous space known as the dural sinuses, which connect to the jugular veins, where blood drains from the head and neck.
13.4The Peripheral Nervous System
The PNSiscomposed ofthe groupsofneurons(ganglia) andbundles ofaxons(nerves) that are outside ofthe brain and
spinal cord. Ganglia are of two types, sensory or autonomic. Sensory ganglia contain unipolar sensory neurons and are

Introduction
Chapter Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Describe the components of the somatic nervous system
• Name the modalities and submodalities of the sensory systems
• Distinguish between general and special senses
• Describe regions of the central nervous system that contribute to somatic functions
• Explain the stimulus-response motor pathway

14.1 | Sensory Perception
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe different types of sensory receptors
• Describe the structures responsible for the special senses of taste, smell, hearing, balance, and vision
• Distinguish how different tastes are transduced
• Describe the means of mechanoreception for hearing and balance
• List the supporting structures around the eye and describe the structure of the eyeball
• Describe the processes of phototransduction
A major role of sensory receptors is to help us learn about the environment around us, or about the state of our internal
environment.Stimulifromvaryingsources,andofdifferenttypes,arereceivedandchangedintotheelectrochemicalsignals

Structural Receptor Types
The cells that interpret information about the environment can be either (1) a neuron that has a free nerve ending, with
dendrites embedded in tissue that would receive a sensation; (2) a neuron that has an encapsulated ending in which the

Sensory Modalities
Ask anyone what the senses are, and they are likely to list the five major senses—taste, smell, touch, hearing, and sight.
However, these are not all of the senses. The most obvious omission from this list is balance. Also, what is referred to
simply as touch can be further subdivided into pressure, vibration, stretch, and hair-follicle position, on the basis of the

Gustation (Taste)
Only a few recognized submodalities exist within the sense of taste, or gustation. Until recently, only four tastes were
recognized:sweet,salty,sour,andbitter.Researchattheturnofthe20thcenturyledtorecognitionofthefifthtaste,umami,

Salty taste is simply the perception of sodium ions (Na+) in the saliva. When you eat something salty, the salt crystals
dissociate into the component ions Na+ and Cl–, which dissolve into the saliva in your mouth. The Na+ concentration
becomeshighoutsidethegustatorycells,creatingastrongconcentrationgradientthatdrivesthediffusionoftheionintothe

Sour taste is the perception of H+ concentration. Just as with sodium ions in salty flavors, these hydrogen ions enter the
cell and trigger depolarization. Sour flavors are, essentially, the perception of acids in our food. Increasing hydrogen ion

depends on which molecule is binding to the receptor.
One major group of bitter-tasting molecules are alkaloids. Alkaloids are nitrogen-containing molecules that often have a
basicpH.Alkaloidsarecommonlyfoundinbitter-tastingplantproducts,suchascoffee,hops(inbeer),tannins(inwine),

tea, and aspirin. By containing toxic alkaloids, the plant is less susceptible to microbe infection and less attractive to
herbivores.
Therefore, the function of bitter taste may primarily be related to stimulating the gag reflex to avoid ingesting poisons.
Because of this, many bitter foods that are normally ingested are often combined with a sweet component to make them
morepalatable(creamandsugarincoffee,forexample).Thehighestconcentrationofbitterreceptorsappeartobeinthe

Olfactory System: Anosmia
Blunt force trauma to the face, such as that common in many car accidents, can lead to the loss of the olfactory
nerve, and subsequently, loss of the sense of smell. This condition is known as anosmia. When the frontal lobe of
the brain moves relative to the ethmoid bone, the olfactory tract axons may be sheared apart. Professional fighters

Audition (Hearing)
Hearing, or audition, is the transduction of sound waves into a neural signal that is made possible by the structures of

are often referred to as the external ear. The middle ear consists of a space spanned by three small bones called the
ossicles. The three ossicles are the malleus, incus, and stapes, which are Latin names that roughly translate to hammer,
anvil, and stirrup. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and articulates with the incus. The incus, in turn,

The semicircular canals are three ring-like extensions of the vestibule. One is oriented in the horizontal plane, whereas
the other two are oriented in the vertical plane. The anterior and posterior vertical canals are oriented at approximately
45 degrees relative to the sagittal plane (Figure 14.12). The base of each semicircular canal, where it meets with the

Other somatosensory receptors are found in the joints and muscles. Stretch receptors monitor the stretching of tendons,
muscles, and the components of joints. For example, have you ever stretched your muscles before or after exercise and
noticed that you can only stretch so far before your muscles spasm back to a less stretched state? This spasm is a reflex
that is initiated by stretch receptors to avoid muscle tearing. Such stretch receptors can also prevent over-contraction

differ in the shape of their outer segment. The rod-shaped outer segments of the rod photoreceptor contain a stack
of membrane-bound discs that contain the photosensitive pigment rhodopsin. The cone-shaped outer segments of the

Opsin pigments are actually transmembrane proteins that contain a cofactor known as retinal. Retinal is a hydrocarbon
molecule related to vitamin A. When a photon hits retinal, the long hydrocarbon chain of the molecule is biochemically

conformation.Thisprocessiscalledphotoisomerization.Beforeinteractingwithaphoton,retinal’sflexibledouble-bonded
carbonsareinthecisconformation.Thismoleculeisreferredtoas11-cis-retinal.Aphotoninteractingwiththemolecule
causes the flexible double-bonded carbons to change to the trans- conformation, forming all-trans-retinal, which has a
straight hydrocarbon chain (Figure 14.17).

Sensory Pathways
Specific regions of the CNS coordinate different somatic processes using sensory inputs and motor outputs of peripheral
nerves. A simple case is a reflex caused by a synapse between a dorsal sensory neuron axon and a motor neuron in the
ventral horn.Morecomplex arrangements arepossible tointegrate peripheral sensoryinformation withhigherprocesses.
The important regions of the CNS that play a role in somatic processes can be separated into the spinal cord brain stem,
diencephalon, cerebral cortex, and subcortical structures.
Spinal Cord and Brain Stem
A sensory pathway that carries peripheral sensations to the brain is referred to as an ascending pathway, or ascending
tract. The various sensory modalities each follow specific pathways through the CNS. Tactile and other somatosensory
stimuliactivatereceptorsintheskin,muscles,tendons,andjointsthroughouttheentirebody.However,thesomatosensory
pathwaysaredividedintotwoseparatesystemsonthebasisofthelocationofthereceptorneurons.Somatosensorystimuli

then decussates, or crosses the midline of the medulla. These axons then continue to ascend the brain stem as a bundle
called the medial lemniscus. These axons terminate in the thalamus, where each synapses with the third neuron in their

These two systems are similar in that they both begin with dorsal root ganglion cells, as with most general sensory
information. The dorsal column system is primarily responsible for touch sensations and proprioception, whereas the
spinothalamic tract pathway is primarily responsible for pain and temperature sensations. Another similarity is that the
second neurons in both of these pathways are contralateral, because they project across the midline to the other side of
thebrainorspinalcord.Inthedorsalcolumnsystem,thisdecussationtakesplaceinthebrainstem;inthespinothalamic

Auditory processing continues on to a nucleus in the midbrain called the inferior colliculus. Axons from the inferior

In addition, a very small number of RGC axons project from the optic chiasm to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the
hypothalamus. These RGCs are photosensitive, in that they respond to the presence or absence of light. Unlike the
photoreceptors, however, these photosensitive RGCs cannot be used to perceive images. By simply responding to the

Diencephalon
The diencephalon is beneath the cerebrum and includes the thalamus and hypothalamus. In the somatic nervous system,
the thalamus is an important relay for communication between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system. The
hypothalamus has both somatic and autonomic functions. In addition, the hypothalamus communicates with the limbic
system, which controls emotions and memory functions.
Sensory input to the thalamus comes from most of the special senses and ascending somatosensory tracts. Each sensory
systemisrelayedthroughaparticularnucleusinthethalamus.Thethalamusisarequiredtransferpointformostsensory
tracts that reach the cerebral cortex, where conscious sensory perception begins. The one exception to this rule is the

The cerebral cortex also maintains this sensory topography in the particular areas of the cortex that correspond to the
position of the receptor cells. The somatosensory cortex provides an example in which, in essence, the locations of the
somatosensory receptors in the body are mapped onto the somatosensory cortex. This mapping is often depicted using a
sensory homunculus(Figure 14.23).

Brain: Prosopagnosia
The failures of sensory perception can be unusual and debilitating. A particular sensory deficit that inhibits an
important social function of humans is prosopagnosia, or face blindness. The word comes from the Greek words

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• List the components of the basic processing stream for the motor system
• Describe the pathway of descending motor commands from the cortex to the skeletal muscles
• Compare different descending pathways, both by structure and function
• Explain the initiation of movement from the neurological connections
• Describe several reflex arcs and their functional roles
The defining characteristic of the somatic nervous system is that it controls skeletal muscles. Somatic senses inform the
nervoussystemabouttheexternalenvironment,buttheresponsetothatisthroughvoluntarymusclemovement.Theterm
“voluntary”suggeststhatthereisaconsciousdecisiontomakeamovement.However,someaspectsofthesomaticsystem
use voluntary muscles without conscious control. One example is the ability of our breathing to switch to unconscious
controlwhilewearefocusedonanothertask.However,themusclesthatareresponsibleforthebasicprocessofbreathing
are also utilized for speech, which is entirely voluntary.
Cortical Responses
Let’sstartwithsensorystimulithathavebeenregisteredthroughreceptorcellsandtheinformationrelayedtotheCNSalong
ascendingpathways.Inthecerebralcortex,theinitialprocessingofsensoryperceptionprogressestoassociativeprocessing
and then integration in multimodal areas of cortex. These levels of processing can lead to the incorporation of sensory
perceptionsintomemory,butmoreimportantly,theyleadtoaresponse.Thecompletionofcorticalprocessingthroughthe
primary,associative,andintegrativesensoryareasinitiatesasimilarprogressionofmotorprocessing,usuallyindifferent
cortical areas.
Whereas the sensory cortical areas are located in the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, motor functions are largely
controlled by the frontal lobe. The most anterior regions of the frontal lobe—the prefrontal areas—are important for
executive functions, which are those cognitive functions that lead to goal-directed behaviors. These higher cognitive
processes include working memory,which has been called a “mental scratch pad,” that can help organize and represent
information that is not in the immediate environment. The prefrontal lobe is responsible for aspects of attention, such as
inhibitingdistractingthoughtsandactionssothatapersoncanfocusonagoalanddirectbehaviortowardachievingthat
goal.
Thefunctionsoftheprefrontalcortexareintegraltothepersonalityofanindividual,becauseitislargelyresponsiblefor
what a person intends to do and how they accomplish those plans. A famous case of damage to the prefrontal cortex is
that of Phineas Gage, dating back to 1848. He was a railroad worker who had a metal spike impale his prefrontal cortex
(Figure 14.27). He survived the accident, but according to second-hand accounts, his personality changed drastically.

movements, such as the buttock and back muscles, occupy much less space on the motor cortex.
Descending Pathways
The motor output from the cortex descends into the brain stem and to the spinal cord to control the musculature through
motorneurons.Neuronslocatedintheprimarymotorcortex,namedBetzcells,arelargecorticalneuronsthatsynapsewith
lower motor neurons in the spinal cord or the brain stem. The two descending pathways travelled by the axons of Betz

The corticospinal tract descends from the cortex through the deep white matter of the cerebrum. It then passes between

the midbrain as the cerebral peduncles, after which it burrows through the pons. Upon entering the medulla, the tracts

Thelumbar enlargementis not as significant in appearance because there is less fine motor control of the lower limbs.
Axial Control
The anterior corticospinal tract is responsible for controlling the muscles of the body trunk (see Figure 14.28). These
axonsdonotdecussateinthemedulla.Instead,theyremaininananteriorpositionastheydescendthebrainstemandenter
the spinal cord.These axonsthen travel tothe spinal cordlevel at which they synapse with alower motor neuron.Upon
reachingtheappropriatelevel,theaxonsdecussate,enteringtheventralhornontheoppositesideofthespinalcordfrom
which they entered. In the ventral horn, these axons synapse with their corresponding lower motor neurons. The lower
motor neurons are located in the medial regions of the ventral horn, because they control the axial muscles of the trunk.
Because movements of the body trunk involve both sides of the body, the anterior corticospinal tract is not entirely
contralateral.Somecollateralbranchesofthetractwillprojectintotheipsilateralventralhorntocontrolsynergisticmuscles
on that side of the body, or to inhibit antagonistic muscles through interneurons within the ventral horn. Through the
influence of both sides of the body, the anterior corticospinal tract can coordinate postural muscles in broad movements
of the body. These coordinating axons in the anterior corticospinal tract are often considered bilateral, as they are both
ipsilateral and contralateral.

Fromthisbriefvideo,onlysomeofthedescendingmotorpathwayofthesomaticnervoussystemisdescribed.Which
division of the pathway is described and which division is left out?
Extrapyramidal Controls
Other descending connections between the brain and the spinal cord are called the extrapyramidal system. The name
comesfromthefactthatthissystemisoutsidethecorticospinal pathway,whichincludesthepyramidsinthemedulla.A
few pathways originating from the brain stem contribute to this system.

Theconsciousmovementofourmusclesismorecomplicatedthansimplysendingasinglecommandfromtheprecentral
gyrus down to the proper motor neurons. During the movement of any body part, our muscles relay information back
to the brain, and the brain is constantly sending “revised” instructions back to the muscles. The cerebellum is important
in contributing to the motor system because it compares cerebral motor commands with proprioceptive feedback. The
corticospinal fibers that project to the ventral horn of the spinal cord have branches that also synapse in the pons, which

Alcohol inhibits the ability of the cerebellum to interpret proprioceptive feedback, making it more difficult to coordinate
body movements, such as walking a straight line, or guide the movement of the hand to touch the tip of the nose.

Reflexes
This chapter began by introducing reflexes as an example of the basic elements of the somatic nervous system. Simple
somatic reflexes do not include the higher centers discussed for conscious or voluntary aspects of movement. Reflexes
can be spinal or cranial, depending on the nerves and central components that are involved. The example described at
thebeginningofthechapterinvolvedheatandpainsensationsfromahotstovecausingwithdrawalofthearmthrougha

fully, more attention needs to be given to this example.

Withthismotorneuronbeinginhibited,thetricepsbrachiirelaxes.Withouttheantagonisticcontraction,withdrawalfrom
the hot stove is faster and keeps further tissue damage from occurring.
Another example of a withdrawal reflex occurs when you step on a painful stimulus, like a tack or a sharp rock. The
nociceptorsthatareactivatedbythepainfulstimulusactivatethemotorneuronsresponsibleforcontractionofthetibialis
anterior muscle. This causes dorsiflexion of the foot. An inhibitory interneuron, activated by a collateral branch of the
nociceptor fiber, will inhibit the motor neurons of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to cancel plantar flexion. An

Contractionofthetibialisanteriorisnotthemostimportantaspectofthereflex,ascontinuationofplantarflexionwillresult
in further damage from stepping onto the tack.
Another type of reflex is a stretch reflex. In this reflex, when a skeletal muscle is stretched, a muscle spindle receptor
is activated. The axon from this receptor structure will cause direct contraction of the muscle. A collateral of the muscle
spindlefiberwillalsoinhibitthemotorneuronoftheantagonistmuscles.Thereflexhelpstomaintainmusclesataconstant

ligament in a physical exam.
A specialized reflex to protect the surface of the eye is the corneal reflex, or the eye blink reflex. When the cornea is
stimulated by a tactile stimulus, or even by bright light in a related reflex, blinking is initiated. The sensory component
travels through the trigeminal nerve, which carries somatosensory information from the face, or through the optic nerve,
ifthe stimulus isbright light. The motor response travels throughthe facial nerve andinnervates the orbicularis oculi on
thesameside.Thisreflexiscommonlytestedduringaphysicalexamusinganairpufforagentletouchofacotton-tipped

The two major tracts in the spinal cord, originating from sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, are the dorsal
column system and the spinothalamic tract. The major differences between the two are in the type of information that is
relayed to the brain and where the tracts decussate. The dorsal column system primarily carries information about touch
and proprioception and crosses the midline in the medulla. The spinothalamic tract is primarily responsible for pain and

Introduction
Chapter Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Describe the components of the autonomic nervous system
• Differentiate between the structures of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions in the autonomic
nervous system
• Name the components of a visceral reflex specific to the autonomic division to which it belongs
• Predict the response of a target effector to autonomic input on the basis of the released signaling molecule
• Describe how the central nervous system coordinates and contributes to autonomic functions
Theautonomicnervoussystemisoftenassociatedwiththe“fight-or-flightresponse,”whichreferstothepreparationofthe

Thisresponseshouldsoundabitfamiliar.Theautonomicnervoussystemistiedintoemotionalresponsesaswell,andthe
fight-or-flight response probably sounds like a panic attack. In the modern world, these sorts of reactions are associated
with anxiety as much as with response to a threat. It is engrained in the nervous system to respond like this. In fact,
the adaptations ofthe autonomic nervous system probably predate the human species and are likely to be common to all
mammals, and perhaps shared by many animals. That lioness might herself be threatened in some other situation.

15.1 | Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Name the components that generate the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses of the autonomic nervous
system
• Explain the differences in output connections within the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system
• Describethesignalingmoleculesandreceptorproteinsinvolvedincommunicationwithinthetwodivisionsofthe
autonomic nervous system
The nervous system can be divided into two functional parts: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous
system. The major differences between the two systems are evident in the responses that each produces. The somatic
nervoussystemcausescontractionofskeletalmuscles.Theautonomicnervoussystemcontrolscardiacandsmoothmuscle,
aswellasglandulartissue.Thesomaticnervoussystemisassociatedwithvoluntaryresponses(thoughmanycanhappen
withoutconsciousawareness,likebreathing),andtheautonomicnervoussystemisassociatedwithinvoluntaryresponses,
such as those related to homeostasis.
The autonomic nervous system regulates many of the internal organs through a balance of two aspects, or divisions. In
addition to the endocrine system, the autonomic nervous system is instrumental in homeostatic mechanisms in the body.

throughout the body.
To continue with the analogy of the circuit diagram, there are three different types of “junctions” that operate within the
sympathetic system (Figure 15.3). The first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion at
the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated). An example of this type is spinal
nerve T1 that synapses with the T1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea. The fibers of this branch are called white
ramicommunicantes(singular=ramuscommunicans);theyaremyelinatedandthereforereferredtoaswhite(seeFigure

neuron(withthepostganglionicfibershownasadashedline).Thisneuronthenprojectstoatargeteffector—inthiscase,
the trachea—viagray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons.
In some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic fiber
emerges. With respect to the “wiring” involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior
orinferiortothelocationofthecentralneuron.AnexampleofthisisspinalnerveT1thatinnervatestheeye.Thespinal

prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain.
Not all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. Additional branches from the ventral nerve root
continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser splanchnic
nerve. For example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of T5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain
before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (seeFigure 15.3c).

Parasympathetic Division of the Autonomic Nervous System
Theparasympatheticdivisionoftheautonomicnervoussystemisnamedbecauseitscentralneuronsarelocatedoneither
sideofthethoracolumbarregionofthespinalcord(para-=“beside”or“near”).Theparasympatheticsystemcanalsobe
referred to as the craniosacral system (or outflow) because the preganglionic neurons are located in nuclei of the brain
stem and the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord.
Theconnections,or“circuits,”oftheparasympatheticdivisionaresimilartothegenerallayoutofthesympatheticdivision
with a few specific differences (Figure 15.4). The preganglionic fibers from the cranial region travel in cranial nerves,
whereaspreganglionicfibersfromthesacralregiontravelinspinalnerves.Thetargetsofthesefibersareterminalganglia,
which are located near—or even within—the target effector. These ganglia are often referred to as intramural ganglia
whentheyarefoundwithinthewallsofthetargetorgan.Thepostganglionicfiberprojectsfromtheterminalgangliaashort
distancetothetargeteffector,ortothespecifictargettissuewithintheorgan.Comparingtherelativelengthsofaxonsinthe
parasympathetic system, the preganglionic fibers are long and the postganglionic fibers are short because the ganglia are
close to—and sometimes within—the target effectors.
The cranial component of the parasympathetic system is based in particular nuclei of the brain stem. In the midbrain,
the Edinger–Westphal nucleus is part of the oculomotor complex, and axons from those neurons travel with the fibers
in the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) that innervate the extraocular muscles. The preganglionic parasympathetic
fiberswithincranialnerveIIIterminateintheciliaryganglion,whichislocatedintheposteriororbit.Thepostganglionic
parasympathetic fibers then project to the smooth muscle of the iris to control pupillary size. In the upper medulla, the
salivatory nuclei contain neurons with axons that project through the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves to ganglia that
control salivary glands. Tear production is influenced by parasympathetic fibers in the facial nerve, which activate a
ganglion, and ultimately the lacrimal (tear) gland. Neurons in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and the nucleus
ambiguusprojectthroughthevagusnerve(cranialnerveX)totheterminalgangliaofthethoracicandabdominalcavities.
Parasympathetic preganglionic fibers primarily influence the heart, bronchi, and esophagus in the thoracic cavity and the
stomach, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, and small intestine of the abdominal cavity. The postganglionic fibers from the
gangliaactivatedbythevagusnerveareoftenincorporatedintothestructureoftheorgan,suchasthemesentericplexus

The term adrenergic should remind you of the word adrenaline, which is associated with the fight-or-flight response
describedatthebeginningofthechapter.Adrenalineandepinephrinearetwonamesforthesamemolecule.Theadrenal
gland (in Latin, ad- = “on top of”; renal = “kidney”) secretes adrenaline. The ending “-ine” refers to the chemical being
derived, or extracted, from the adrenal gland. A similar construction from Greek instead of Latin results in the word
epinephrine(epi-=“above”;nephr-=“kidney”).Inscientificusage,epinephrineispreferredintheUnitedStates,whereas
adrenaline is preferred in Great Britain, because “adrenalin” was once a registered, proprietary drug name in the United
States.Thoughthedrugisnolongersold,theconventionofreferringtothismoleculebythetwodifferentnamespersists.
Similarly, norepinephrine and noradrenaline are two names for the same molecule.
Having understood the cholinergic and adrenergic systems, their role in the autonomic system is relatively simple to
understand. All preganglionic fibers, both sympathetic and parasympathetic, release ACh. All ganglionic neurons—the
targetsofthesepreganglionicfibers—havenicotinicreceptorsintheircellmembranes.Thenicotinicreceptorisaligand-
gated cation channel that results in depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. The postganglionic parasympathetic

and do not exclusively cause depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release
norepinephrine,exceptforfibersthatprojecttosweatglandsandtobloodvesselsassociatedwithskeletalmuscles,which
release ACh (Table 15.1).

Signaling molecules can belong to two broad groups. Neurotransmitters are released at synapses, whereas hormones are
released into the bloodstream. These are simplistic definitions, but they can help to clarify this point. Acetylcholine can

challenge.Postganglionicsympathetic fibersreleasenorepinephrine,whichcanbeconsideredaneurotransmitter.Butthe
adrenal medulla releases epinephrine and norepinephrine into circulation, so they should be considered hormones.
What are referred to here as synapses may not fit the strictest definition of synapse. Some sources will refer to the
connection between a postganglionic fiber and a target effector as neuroeffector junctions; neurotransmitters, as defined
above,wouldbecalledneuromodulators.Thestructureofpostganglionicconnectionsarenotthetypicalsynapticendbulb

Fight or Flight? What About Fright and Freeze?
Theoriginalusageoftheepithet“fightorflight”comesfromascientistnamedWalterCannonwhoworkedatHarvard
in 1915. The concept of homeostasis and the functioning of the sympathetic system had been introduced in France
in the previous century. Cannon expanded the idea, and introduced the idea that an animal responds to a threat by
preparing to stand and fight or run away. The nature of this response was thoroughly explained in a book on the
physiology of pain, hunger, fear, and rage.
Whenstudentslearnaboutthesympatheticsystemandthefight-or-flightresponse,theyoftenstopandwonderabout
otherresponses.Ifyouwerefacedwithalionessrunningtowardyouaspicturedatthebeginningofthischapter,would
yourunorwouldyoustandyourground?Somepeoplewouldsaythattheywouldfreezeandnotknowwhattodo.
So isn’t there really more to what the autonomic system does than fight, flight, rest, or digest. What about fear and
paralysis in the face of a threat?
Thecommonepithetof“fightorflight”isbeingenlargedtobe“fight,flight,orfright”oreven“fight,flight,fright,
or freeze.” Cannon’s original contribution was a catchy phrase to express some of what the nervous system does in
response to a threat, but it is incomplete. The sympathetic system is responsible for the physiological responses to
emotionalstates.Thename“sympathetic”canbesaidtomeanthat(sym-=“together”;-pathos=“pain,”“suffering,”
or “emotion”).

Thoughvisceralsensesarenotprimarilyapartofconsciousperception,thosesensationssometimesmakeittoconscious
awareness. If a visceral sense is strong enough, it will be perceived. The sensory homunculus—the representation of the
body in the primary somatosensory cortex—only has a small region allotted for the perception of internal stimuli. If you
swallowalargebolusoffood,forinstance,youwillprobablyfeelthelumpofthatfoodasitpushesthroughyouresophagus,
or even if your stomach is distended after a large meal. If you inhale especially cold air, you can feel it as it enters your
larynx and trachea. These sensations are not the same as feeling high blood pressure or blood sugar levels.
When particularly strong visceral sensations rise to the level of conscious perception, the sensations are often felt in
unexpected places. For example, strong visceral sensations of the heart will be felt as pain in the left shoulder and left
arm.Thisirregularpatternofprojectionofconsciousperceptionofvisceralsensationsiscalledreferredpain.Depending
on the organ system affected, the referred pain will project to different areas of the body (Figure 15.7). The location of
referred pain is not random, but a definitive explanation of the mechanism has not been established. The most broadly
accepted theoryforthisphenomenonisthatthevisceral sensoryfibersenterintothesamelevelofthespinalcordasthe

Projections from the medial and inferior divisions of the cervical ganglia do enter the spinal cord at the middle to lower
cervical levels, which is where the somatosensory fibers enter.

Balance in Competing Autonomic Reflex Arcs
Theautonomicnervoussystemisimportantforhomeostasisbecauseitstwodivisionscompeteatthetargeteffector.The
balance of homeostasis is attributable to the competing inputs from the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions (dual
innervation). Atthelevel ofthetargeteffector,thesignal ofwhichsystem issendingthemessage isstrictly chemical. A
signaling molecule binds to a receptor that causes changes in the target cell, which in turn causes the tissue or organ to
respond to the changing conditions of the body.
Competing Neurotransmitters
The postganglionic fibers of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions both release neurotransmitters that bind to
receptors on their targets. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, with a minor exception, whereas
postganglionicparasympatheticfibersreleaseACh.Foranygiventarget,thedifferenceinwhichdivisionoftheautonomic

Inthesympatheticsystem,thereareexceptionstothispatternofdualinnervation.Thepostganglionicsympatheticfibers
that contact the blood vessels within skeletal muscle and that contact sweat glands do not release norepinephrine, they

have muscarinic receptors and produce and secrete sweat in response to the presence of ACh.
Atmostoftheothertargetsoftheautonomicsystem,theeffectorresponseisbasedonwhichneurotransmitterisreleased
and what receptor is present. For example, regions of the heart that establish heart rate are contacted by postganglionic
fibersfrombothsystems. Ifnorepinephrine isreleased ontothosecells, itbindstoanadrenergicreceptor that causes the

slowing the heart down from its intrinsic rate of 100 bpm, the heart can be said to be in parasympathetic tone.
In a similar fashion, another aspect of the cardiovascular system is primarily under sympathetic control. Blood pressure
is partially determined by the contraction of smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels. These tissues have adrenergic
receptors that respond to the release of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic fibers by constricting and
increasing blood pressure. The hormones released from the adrenal medulla—epinephrine and norepinephrine—will also

The Medulla
The medulla contains nuclei referred to as the cardiovascular center, which controls the smooth and cardiac muscle
of the cardiovascular system through autonomic connections. When the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system shifts,
such as when blood pressure changes, the coordination of the autonomic system can be accomplished within this region.
Furthermore, when descending inputs from the hypothalamus stimulate this area, the sympathetic system can increase
activity in the cardiovascular system, such as in response to anxiety or stress. The preganglionic sympathetic fibers that
are responsible for increasing heart rate are referred to as the cardiac accelerator nerves, whereas the preganglionic
sympathetic fibers responsible for constricting blood vessels compose thevasomotor nerves.

Exercise and the Autonomic System
In addition to its association with the fight-or-flight response and rest-and-digest functions, the autonomic system
is responsible for certain everyday functions. For example, it comes into play when homeostatic mechanisms

Allganglionic neuronsoftheautonomic system,inbothsympathetic andparasympathetic ganglia,areactivated byACh

Sympathetic Effect
Theneurochemistryofthesympatheticsystemisbasedontheadrenergicsystem.Norepinephrineandepinephrineinfluence
target effectors by binding to the α-adrenergic or β-adrenergic receptors. Drugs that affect the sympathetic system affect
these chemical systems. Thedrugscanbeclassified bywhether theyenhance thefunctions ofthesympathetic system or
interruptthosefunctions.Adrugthatenhancesadrenergicfunctionisknownasasympathomimeticdrug,whereasadrug
that interrupts adrenergic function is asympatholytic drug.
Sympathomimetic Drugs
Whenthesympatheticsystemisnotfunctioningcorrectlyorthebodyisinastateofhomeostaticimbalance,thesedrugs
act at postganglionic terminals and synapses in the sympathetic efferent pathway. These drugs either bind to particular
adrenergic receptors and mimic norepinephrine at the synapses between sympathetic postganglionic fibers and their
targets, or they increase the production and release of norepinephrine from postganglionic fibers. Also, to increase the
effectivenessofadrenergicchemicalsreleasedfromthefibers,someofthesedrugsmayblocktheremovalorreuptakeof
the neurotransmitter from the synapse.
Acommonsympathomimeticdrugisphenylephrine,whichisacommoncomponentofdecongestants.Itcanalsobeused

such as in Robitussin CF®.
Arelatedmolecule,calledpseudoephedrine,wasmuchmorecommonlyusedintheseapplicationsthanwasphenylephrine,
until the molecule became useful in the illicit production of amphetamines. Phenylephrine is not as effective as a drug
642 CHAPTER 15 | THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM
because it can be partially broken down in the digestive tract before it is ever absorbed. Like the adrenergic agents,
phenylephrineiseffectiveindilatingthepupil,knownasmydriasis(Figure15.14).Phenylephrineisusedduringaneye
exam in an ophthalmologist’s or optometrist’s office for this purpose. It can also be used to increase blood pressure in
situations in which cardiac function is compromised, such as under anesthesia or during septic shock.
Figure 15.14 Mydriasis The sympathetic system causes pupillary dilation when norepinephrine binds to an
adrenergic receptor in the radial fibers of the iris smooth muscle. Phenylephrine mimics this action by binding to the
same receptor when drops are applied onto the surface of the eye in a doctor’s office. (credit: Corey Theiss)
Other drugs that enhance adrenergic function are not associated with therapeutic uses, but affect the functions of the
sympatheticsysteminasimilarfashion.Cocaineprimarilyinterfereswiththeuptakeofdopamineatthesynapseandcan
also increase adrenergic function. Caffeine is an antagonist to a different neurotransmitter receptor, called the adenosine
receptor. Adenosine will suppress adrenergic activity, specifically the release of norepinephrine at synapses, so caffeine
indirectlyincreasesadrenergicactivity.Thereissomeevidencethatcaffeinecanaidinthetherapeuticuseofdrugs,perhaps
bypotentiating(increasing)sympatheticfunction,asissuggestedbytheinclusionofcaffeineinover-the-counteranalgesics

drugs of this class will be specific to α-adrenergic or β-adrenergic receptors, or to their receptor subtypes.
Possiblythemostfamiliartypeofsympatholyticdrugaretheβ-blockers.Thesedrugsareoftenusedtotreatcardiovascular

vesselstodilate,orkeepingheartratefromincreasing,thesedrugscanimprovecardiacfunctioninacompromisedsystem,
such as for a person with congestive heart failure or who has previously suffered a heart attack. A couple of common
versions of β-blockers are metaprolol, which specifically blocks the β2-receptor, and propanolol, which nonspecifically
blocks β-receptors. There are other drugs that are α-blockers and can affect the sympathetic system in a similar way.
Other uses for sympatholytic drugs are as antianxiety medications. A common example of this is clonidine, which is an
α-blocker.Thesympatheticsystemistiedtoanxietytothepointthatthesympatheticresponsecanbereferredtoas“fight,

attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Parasympathetic Effects
Drugsaffectingparasympatheticfunctionscanbeclassifiedintothosethatincreaseordecreaseactivityatpostganglionic
terminals. Parasympathetic postganglionic fibers release ACh, and the receptors on the targets are muscarinic receptors.
There are several types of muscarinic receptors, M1–M5, but the drugs are not usually specific to the specific types.
Parasympatheticdrugscanbeeithermuscarinicagonistsorantagonists,orhaveindirecteffectsonthecholinergicsystem.
Drugs that enhance cholinergic effects are called parasympathomimetic drugs, whereas those that inhibit cholinergic
effects are referred to asanticholinergic drugs.

asiscausedbyphenylephrine, andcanbeadministered afteraneyeexam.Alongwithconstricting thepupilthroughthe

Autonomic Nervous System
Approximately 33 percent of people experience a mild problem with motion sickness, whereas up to 66 percent
experience motion sickness under extreme conditions, such as being on a tossing boat with no view of the horizon.
Connections between regions in the brain stem and the autonomic system result in the symptoms of nausea, cold
sweats, and vomiting.
The part of the brain responsible for vomiting, or emesis, is known as the area postrema. It is located next to the
fourth ventricle and is not restricted by the blood–brain barrier, which allows it to respond to chemicals in the
bloodstream—namely, toxins that will stimulate emesis. There are significant connections between this area, the
solitarynucleus,andthedorsalmotornucleusofthevagusnerve.Theseautonomicsystemandnucleiconnectionsare

The autonomic system integrates sensory information and higher cognitive processes to generate output, which balances
homeostatic mechanisms. The central autonomic structure is the hypothalamus, which coordinates sympathetic and

16.1 | Overview of the Neurological Exam
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• List the major sections of the neurological exam
• Explain the connection between location and function in the nervous system
• Explain the benefit of a rapid assessment for neurological function in a clinical setting
• List the causes of neurological deficits
• Describe the different ischemic events in the nervous system
The neurological exam is a clinical assessment tool used to determine what specific parts of the CNS are affected by
damage or disease. It can be performed in a short time—sometimes as quickly as 5 minutes—to establish neurological
function.Intheemergencydepartment,thisrapidassessmentcanmakethedifferencewithrespecttopropertreatmentand

whichteststhefunctionofthe12cranialnervesand,therefore,thecentralandperipheralstructuresassociatedwiththem.
The cranial nerve exam tests the sensory and motor functions of each of the nerves, as applicable. Two major sections,
the sensory exam and the motor exam, test the sensory and motor functions associated with spinal nerves. Finally, the
coordination exam tests the ability to perform complex and coordinated movements. The gait exam, which is often
considered a sixth major exam, specifically assesses the motor function of walking and can be considered part of the
coordination exam because walking is a coordinated movement.

deficits that compromise many aspects of the mental status exam, or movement deficits that compromise aspects of the
cranial nerve exam, the motor exam, or the coordination exam. The causes of these disorders are also varied. Some are

Finally, a common cause of neurological changes is observed in developmental disorders. Whether the result of genetic
factors or the environment during development, there are certain situations that result in neurological functions being
different from the expected norms. Developmental disorders are difficult to define because they are caused by defects
that existed in the past and disrupted the normal development of the CNS. These defects probably involve multiple

16.2 | The Mental Status Exam
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the relationship of mental status exam results to cerebral functions
• Explain the categorization of regions of the cortex based on anatomy and physiology
• Differentiate between primary, association, and integration areas of the cerebral cortex
• Provide examples of localization of function related to the cerebral cortex

on the outside of the cerebrum. It is approximately a millimeter thick in most regions and highly folded to fit within the

locations can be said to be responsible for particular functions. There is a limited set of regions, for example, that are
involvedinlanguagefunction,andtheycanbesubdividedonthebasisoftheparticularpartoflanguagefunctionthateach
governs.
The basis for parceling out areas of the cortex and attributing them to various functions has its root in pure anatomical
underpinnings. The German neurologist and histologist Korbinian Brodmann, who made a careful study of the
cytoarchitecture of the cerebrum around the turn of the nineteenth century, described approximately 50 regions of the
cortex that differed enough from each other to be considered separate areas (Figure 16.4). Brodmann made preparations
of many different regions of the cerebral cortex to view with a microscope. He compared the size, shape, and number
of neurons to find anatomical differences in the various parts of the cerebral cortex. Continued investigation into these
anatomicalareasoverthesubsequent100ormoreyearshasdemonstratedastrongcorrelationbetweenthestructuresandthe

conceptofthesensoryhomunculus,aswellasthedifferentsubmodalitiesofsomatosensationsuchastouch,vibration,pain,
temperature, or proprioception. Today, we more frequently refer to these regions by their function (i.e., primary sensory
cortex) than by the number Brodmann assigned to them, but in some situations the use of Brodmann numbers persists.

demonstrates the strong link between structure and function in these regions.
Areas 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, and 22 are each described as primary cortical areas. The adjoining regions are each referred to
as association areas. Primary areas are where sensory information is initially received from the thalamus for conscious
perception,or—inthecaseoftheprimarymotorcortex—wheredescendingcommandsaresentdowntothebrainstemor
spinal cord to execute movements (Figure 16.5).

A number of other regions, which extend beyond these primary or association areas of the cortex, are referred to as
integrativeareas.Theseareasarefoundinthespacesbetweenthedomainsforparticularsensoryormotorfunctions,and
they integrate multisensory information, or process sensory or motor information in more complex ways. Consider, for

Cognitive Abilities
Assessment of cerebral functions is directed at cognitive abilities. The abilities assessed through the mental status exam
can be separated into four groups: orientation and memory, language and speech, sensorium, and judgment and abstract
reasoning.
Orientation and Memory
Orientation is the patient’s awareness of his or her immediate circumstances. It is awareness of time, not in terms of the
clock, but of the date and what is occurring around the patient. It is awareness of place, such that a patient should know
whereheorsheisandwhy.Itisalsoawarenessofwhothepatientis—recognizingpersonalidentityandbeingabletorelate
that to the examiner. The initial tests of orientation are based on the questions, “Do you know what the date is?” or “Do
youknowwhereyouare?”or“Whatisyourname?”Furtherunderstandingofapatient’sawarenessoforientationcancome

an order, or to spell common words backwards, or to recite a list of numbers back.
Memory is largely a function of the temporal lobe, along with structures beneath the cerebral cortex such as the
hippocampus and the amygdala. The storage of memory requires these structures of the medial temporal lobe. A famous
case of a man who had both medial temporal lobes removed to treat intractable epilepsy provided insight into the
relationship between the structures of the brain and the function of memory.
Henry Molaison, who was referred to as patient HM when he was alive, had epilepsy localized to both of his medial
temporal lobes. In 1953, a bilateral lobectomy was performed that alleviated the epilepsy but resulted in the inability for

temporal lobe).
The prefrontal cortex can also be tested for the ability to organize information. In one subtest of the mental status exam
called set generation, the patient is asked to generate a list of words that all start with the same letter, but not to include
propernounsornames.Theexpectationisthatapersoncangeneratesuchalistofatleast10wordswithin1minute.Many

fundamentalanswertothisquestionissuggestedbythefamousquotebyRenéDescartes:“CogitoErgoSum”(translated
from Latin as “I think, therefore I am”). Formulating an understanding of yourself is largely describing who you are to
yourself. It is a confusing topic to delve into, but language is certainly at the core of what it means to be self-aware.

Figure 16.6 Broca's and Wernicke's Areas Two important integration areas of the cerebral cortex associated with
language function are Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. The two areas are connected through the deep white matter
running from the posterior temporal lobe to the frontal lobe.
Sensorium
Those parts of the brain involved in the reception and interpretation of sensory stimuli are referred to collectively as the
sensorium. The cerebral cortex has several regions that are necessary for sensory perception. From the primary cortical
areasofthesomatosensory,visual,auditory,andgustatorysensestotheassociationareasthatprocessinformationinthese
modalities, the cerebral cortex is the seat of conscious sensory perception. In contrast, sensory information can also be
processedbydeeperbrainregions,whichwemayvaguelydescribeassubconscious—forinstance,wearenotconstantly
aware of the proprioceptive information that the cerebellum uses to maintain balance. Several of the subtests can reveal
activityassociatedwiththesesensorymodalities,suchasbeingabletohearaquestionorseeapicture.Twosubtestsassess

associate it with a name for that object. Both subtests have language components because language function is integral
to these functions. The relationship between the words that describe actions, or the nouns that represent objects, and
the cerebral location of these concepts is suggested to be localized to particular cortical areas. Certain aphasias can be
characterized by a deficit of verbs or nouns, known as V impairment or N impairment, or may be classified as V–N

Judgment and Abstract Reasoning

Theprefrontalcortexisresponsibleforthefunctionsresponsibleforplanningandmakingdecisions.Inthementalstatus
exam, the subtest that assesses judgment and reasoning is directed at three aspects of frontal lobe function. First, the
examiner asksquestionsaboutproblemsolving,suchas“Ifyouseeahouseonfire,whatwouldyoudo?”Thepatient is
alsoaskedtointerpretcommonproverbs,suchas“Don’tlookagifthorseinthemouth.”Additionally,pairsofwordsare
compared for similarities, such as apple and orange, or lamp and cabinet.
Theprefrontalcortexiscomposedoftheregionsofthefrontallobethatarenotdirectlyrelatedtospecificmotorfunctions.
The most posterior region of the frontal lobe, the precentral gyrus, is the primary motor cortex. Anterior to that are the
premotor cortex, Broca’s area, and the frontal eye fields, which are all related to planning certain types of movements.

are judging whether those movements should be made, as in the example of deciding whether to hit the snooze button.
To an extent, the prefrontal cortex may be related to personality. The neurological exam does not necessarily assess
personality, but it can be within the realm of neurology or psychiatry. A clinical situation that suggests this link between

A psychiatric practice to deal with various disorders was the prefrontal lobotomy. This procedure was common in the
1940s and early 1950s, until antipsychotic drugs became available. The connections between the prefrontal cortex and
other regions of the brain were severed. The disorders associated with this procedure included some aspects of what are
now referred to as personality disorders, but also included mood disorders and psychoses. Depictions of lobotomies in

16.3 | The Cranial Nerve Exam
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the functional grouping of cranial nerves
• Match the regions of the forebrain and brain stem that are connected to each cranial nerve
• Suggest diagnoses that would explain certain losses of function in the cranial nerves
• Relate cranial nerve deficits to damage of adjacent, unrelated structures
Thetwelvecranialnervesaretypicallycoveredinintroductoryanatomycourses,andmemorizingtheirnamesisfacilitated
by numerous mnemonics developed by students over the years of this practice. But knowing the names of the nerves in
orderoftenleavesmuchtobedesiredinunderstandingwhatthenervesdo.Thenervescanbecategorizedbyfunctions,and
subtests of the cranial nerve exam can clarify these functional groupings.
Three of the nerves are strictly responsible for special senses whereas four others contain fibers for special and general
senses. Three nerves are connected to the extraocular muscles resulting in the control of gaze. Four nerves connect to
muscles of the face, oral cavity, and pharynx, controlling facial expressions, mastication, swallowing, and speech. Four
nerves make up the cranial component of the parasympathetic nervous system responsible for pupillary constriction,
salivation, and the regulation of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities. Finally, one nerve controls the
muscles of the neck, assisting with spinal control of the movement of the head and neck.

Hearing is tested by using a tuning fork in a couple of different ways. The Rinne test involves using a tuning fork
to distinguish between conductive hearing and sensorineural hearing. Conductive hearing relies on vibrations being
conducted through the ossicles of the middle ear. Sensorineural hearing is the transmission of sound stimuli through the
neural components of the inner ear and cranial nerve. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process and the

The trigeminal system of the head and neck is the equivalent of the ascending spinal cord systems of the dorsal column
and the spinothalamic pathways. Somatosensation of the face is conveyed along the nerve to enter the brain stem at the
level of the pons. Synapses of those axons, however, are distributed across nuclei found throughout the brain stem. The
mesencephalic nucleus processes proprioceptive information of the face, which is the movement and position of facial
muscles. It is the sensory component of the jaw-jerk reflex, a stretch reflex of the masseter muscle. The chief nucleus,
locatedinthepons,receivesinformationaboutlighttouchaswellasproprioceptiveinformationaboutthemandible,which

Motor Nerves of the Neck
The accessory nerve, also referred to as the spinal accessory nerve, innervates the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius
muscles (Figure 16.11). When both the sternocleidomastoids contract, the head flexes forward; individually, they cause
rotation to the opposite side. The trapezius can act as an antagonist, causing extension and hyperextension of the neck.
These two superficial muscles are important for changing the position of the head. Both muscles also receive input from

The olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves are strictly sensory nerves for smell, sight, and balance and hearing,
whereas the trigeminal, facial, and glossopharyngeal nerves carry somatosensation of the face, and taste—separated
between the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and the posterior one-third. Special senses are tested by presenting the
particular stimuli to each receptive organ. General senses can be tested through sensory discrimination of touch versus
painful stimuli.

motion, proprioception, is tested by moving the fingers or toes and asking the patient if they sense the movement. If the
distal locations are not perceived, the test is repeated at increasingly proximal joints.
The various stimuli used to test sensory input assess the function of the major ascending tracts of the spinal cord.
The dorsal column pathway conveys fine touch, vibration, and proprioceptive information, whereas the spinothalamic
pathwayprimarilyconveyspainandtemperature.Testingthesestimuliprovidesinformationaboutwhetherthesetwomajor
ascending pathways are functioning properly. Within the spinal cord, the two systems are segregated. The dorsal column
information ascends ipsilateral to the source of the stimulus and decussates in the medulla, whereas the spinothalamic
pathway decussates at the level of entry and ascends contralaterally. The differing sensory stimuli are segregated in the
spinalcordsothatthevarioussubtestsforthesestimulicandistinguishwhichascendingpathwaymaybedamagedincertain
situations.
676 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM
Whereas the basic sensory stimuli are assessed in the subtests directed at each submodality of somatosensation, testing
the ability to discriminate sensations is important. Pairing the light touch and pain subtests together makes it possible to

painfulstimuliforlighttouch,orviceversa,maypointtoerrorsinascendingprojections,suchasinahemisectionofthe

Another issue of sensory discrimination is not distinguishing between different submodalities, but rather location. The
two-point discrimination subtest highlights the density ofsensory endings, and therefore receptive fields in the skin. The
sensitivitytofinetouch,whichcangiveindicationsofthetextureanddetailedshapeofobjects,ishighestinthefingertips.

Comparison of Upper and Lower Motor Neuron Damage
Many of the tests of motor function can indicate differences that will address whether damage to the motor system is
in the upper or lower motor neurons. Signs that suggest a UMN lesion include muscle weakness, strong deep tendon
reflexes, decreased control of movement or slowness, pronator drift, a positive Babinski sign, spasticity, and the clasp-
kniferesponse.Spasticityisanexcesscontractioninresistancetostretch.Itcanresultinhyperflexia,whichiswhenjoints
678 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM
are overly flexed. The clasp-knife response occurs when the patient initially resists movement, but then releases, and the
joint will quickly flex like a pocket knife closing.
A lesion on the LMN would result in paralysis, or at least partial loss of voluntary muscle control, which is known as
paresis.TheparalysisobservedinLMNdiseasesisreferredtoasflaccidparalysis,referringtoacompleteorpartialloss

Spinal Cord
In certain situations, such as a motorcycle accident, only half of the spinal cord may be damaged in what is known

be paralyzed. The sensory results are more complicated.
The ascending tracts inthe spinal cordare segregated between the dorsal column andspinothalamic pathways. This
means that the sensory deficits will be based on the particular sensory information each pathway conveys. Sensory
discrimination between touch and painful stimuli will illustrate the difference in how these pathways divide these
functions.
Ontheparalyzedleg,apatientwillacknowledgepainfulstimuli,butnotfinetouchorproprioceptivesensations.On
the functional leg, the opposite is true. The reason for this is that the dorsal column pathway ascends ipsilateral to
the sensation, so it would be damaged the same way as the lateral corticospinal tract. The spinothalamic pathway
decussatesimmediatelyuponenteringthespinalcordandascendscontralateraltothesource;itwouldthereforebypass
the hemisection.
Themotorsystem canindicate thelossofinputtotheventral horninthelumbar enlargement wheremotorneurons

can be related to motor learning, fits with the neural connections of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is 10 percent of the
mass of the brain and has varied functions that all point to a role in the motor system.
Location and Connections of the Cerebellum
Thecerebellumislocatedinappositiontothedorsalsurfaceofthebrainstem,centeredonthepons.Thenameofthepons
is derived from its connection to the cerebellum. The word means “bridge” and refers to the thick bundle of myelinated
axonsthatformabulgeonitsventralsurface.Thosefibersareaxonsthatprojectfromthegraymatteroftheponsintothe

the other regions of the brain stem. The superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) is the connection of the cerebellum to the
midbrain and forebrain. Theinferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP)is the connection to the medulla.
Figure 16.14 Cerebellar Penduncles The connections to the cerebellum are the three cerebellar peduncles, which
are close to each other. The ICP arises from the medulla—specifically from the inferior olive, which is visible as a
bulgeontheventralsurfaceofthebrainstem.TheMCPistheventralsurfaceofthepons.TheSCPprojectsintothe

These connections can also be broadly described by their functions. The ICP conveys sensory input to the cerebellum,

If the cerebral cortex sends a motor command to initiate walking, that command is copied by the pons and sent into the
cerebellum through the MCP. Sensory feedback in the form of proprioception from the spinal cord, as well as vestibular
sensationsfromtheinnerear,entersthroughtheICP.Ifyoutakeastepandbegintosliponthefloorbecauseitiswet,the

The cerebellum is divided into regions that are based on the particular functions and connections involved. The midline
regionsofthecerebellum,thevermisandflocculonodularlobe,areinvolvedincomparingvisualinformation,equilibrium,
and proprioceptive feedback to maintain balance and coordinate movements such as walking, or gait, through the
descending output of the red nucleus (Figure 16.15). The lateral hemispheres are primarily concerned with planning
motor functions through frontal lobe inputs that are returned through the thalamic projections back to the premotor and

Coordination and Alternating Movement
Testing for cerebellar function is the basis of the coordination exam. The subtests target appendicular musculature,
controlling the limbs, and axial musculature for posture and gait. The assessment of cerebellar function will depend on
thenormalfunctioningofothersystemsaddressedinprevioussectionsoftheneurologicalexam.Motorcontrolfromthe
cerebrum, as well as sensory input from somatic, visual, and vestibular senses, are important to cerebellar function.
The subtests that address appendicular musculature, and therefore the lateral regions of the cerebellum, begin with a
check for tremor. The patient extends their arms in front of them and holds the position. The examiner watches for the
presence of tremors that would not be present if the muscles are relaxed. By pushing down on the arms in this position,
theexaminercancheckforthereboundresponse,whichiswhenthearmsareautomaticallybroughtbacktotheextended
position. The extension of the arms is an ongoing motor process, and the tap or push on the arms presents a change in
theproprioceptivefeedback.Thecerebellumcomparesthecerebralmotorcommandwiththeproprioceptivefeedbackand

walking and balance. Testing posture and gait addresses functions of the spinocerebellum and the vestibulocerebellum
because both are part of these activities. A subtest called station begins with the patient standing in a normal position to
check for the placement of the feet and balance. The patient is asked to hop on one foot to assess the ability to maintain
balanceandpostureduringmovement.ThoughthestationsubtestappearstobesimilartotheRombergtest,thedifference

Ataxia
A movement disorder of the cerebellum is referred to as ataxia. It presents as a loss of coordination in voluntary
movements. Ataxia can also refer to sensory deficits that cause balance problems, primarily in proprioception and
equilibrium.Whentheproblemisobservedinmovement,itisascribedtocerebellardamage.Sensoryandvestibularataxia
would likely also present with problems in gait and station.
Ataxia is often the result of exposure to exogenous substances, focal lesions, or a genetic disorder. Focal lesions include
strokes affecting the cerebellar arteries, tumors that may impinge on the cerebellum, trauma to the back of the head and
neck, or MS. Alcohol intoxication or drugs such as ketamine cause ataxia, but it is often reversible. Mercury in fish
can cause ataxia as well. Hereditary conditions can lead to degeneration of the cerebellum or spinal cord, as well as
malformation of the brain, or the abnormal accumulation of copper seen in Wilson’s disease.

682 CHAPTER 16 | THE NEUROLOGICAL EXAM
The Field Sobriety Test
The neurological exam has been described as a clinical tool throughout this chapter. It is also useful in other ways.
A variation of the coordination exam is the Field Sobriety Test (FST) used to assess whether drivers are under the
influence of alcohol. The cerebellum is crucial for coordinated movements such as keeping balance while walking,
ormovingappendicularmusculatureonthebasisofproprioceptivefeedback.Thecerebellumisalsoverysensitiveto
ethanol, the particular type of alcohol found in beer, wine, and liquor.
Walkinginastraightlineinvolvescomparingthemotorcommandfromtheprimarymotorcortextotheproprioceptive
and vestibular sensory feedback, as well as following the visual guide of the white line on the side of the road.
Whenthecerebellumiscompromisedbyalcohol,thecerebellumcannotcoordinatethesemovementseffectively,and
maintaining balance becomes difficult.
AnothercommonaspectoftheFSTistohavethedriverextendtheirarmsoutwideandtouchtheirfingertiptotheir
nose, usually with their eyes closed. The point of this is to remove the visual feedback for the movement and force
the driver to rely just on proprioceptive information about the movement and position of their fingertip relative to
their nose. With eyes open, the corrections to the movement of the arm might be so small as to be hard to see, but
proprioceptivefeedbackisnotasimmediateandbroadermovementsofthearmwillprobablybeneeded,particularly
if the cerebellum is affected by alcohol.
Reciting the alphabet backwards is not always a component of the FST, but its relationship to neurological function
is interesting. There is a cognitive aspect to remembering how the alphabet goes and how to recite it backwards.
Thatisactuallyavariationofthementalstatussubtestofrepeatingthemonthsbackwards.However,thecerebellum
is important because speech production is a coordinated activity. The speech rapid alternating movement subtest
is specifically using the consonant changes of “lah-kah-pah” to assess coordinated movements of the lips, tongue,
pharynx, and palate. But the entire alphabet, especially in the nonrehearsed backwards order, pushes this type of
coordinated movement quite far. It is related to the reason that speech becomes slurred when a person is intoxicated.

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 693
In addition, endocrine signaling is typically less specific than neural signaling. The same hormone may play a role in a
variety of different physiological processes depending on the target cells involved. For example, the hormone oxytocin
promotesuterinecontractionsinwomeninlabor.Itisalsoimportantinbreastfeeding,andmaybeinvolvedinthesexual
response and in feelings of emotional attachment in both males and females.
In general, the nervous system involves quick responses to rapid changes in the external environment, and the endocrine
system is usually slower acting—taking care of the internal environment of the body, maintaining homeostasis, and
controlling reproduction (Table 17.1). So how does the fight-or-flight response that was mentioned earlier happen so
quickly if hormones are usually slower acting? It is because the two systems are connected. It is the fast action of the

Structures of the Endocrine System
The endocrine system consists of cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones as a primary or secondary function.
The endocrine gland is the major player in this system. The primary function ofthese ductless glands is to secrete their
hormones directly into the surrounding fluid. The interstitial fluid and the blood vessels then transport the hormones
throughoutthebody.Theendocrinesystemincludesthepituitary,thyroid,parathyroid,adrenal,andpinealglands(Figure

Endocrinologist
Endocrinology is a specialty in the field of medicine that focuses on the treatment of endocrine system disorders.
Endocrinologists—medical doctors who specialize in this field—are experts in treating diseases associated with
hormonal systems, ranging from thyroid disease to diabetes mellitus. Endocrine surgeons treat endocrine disease
through the removal, or resection, of the affected endocrine gland.
Patientswhoarereferredtoendocrinologistsmayhavesignsandsymptomsorbloodtestresultsthatsuggestexcessive

endocrinedisorders,suchastype2diabetes, mayrespondtolifestyle changessuchasmodestweightloss,adoption
ofahealthydiet,andregularphysicalactivity.Otherdisordersmayrequiremedication,suchashormonereplacement,
and routine monitoring by the endocrinologist. These include disorders of the pituitary gland that can affect growth
and disorders of the thyroid gland that can result in a variety of metabolic problems.
Some patients experience health problems as a result of the normal decline in hormones that can accompany aging.
These patients can consult with an endocrinologist to weigh the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy
intended to boost their natural levels of reproductive hormones.
In addition to treating patients, endocrinologists may be involved in research to improve the understanding of
endocrine system disorders and develop new treatments for these diseases.
17.2 | Hormones
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify the three major classes of hormones on the basis of chemical structure
• Compare and contrast intracellular and cell membrane hormone receptors
• Describe signaling pathways that involve cAMP and IP3
• Identify several factors that influence a target cell’s response
• Discuss the role of feedback loops and humoral, hormonal, and neural stimuli in hormone control
Although a given hormone may travel throughout the body in the bloodstream, it will affect the activity only of its
target cells; that is, cells with receptors for that particular hormone. Once the hormone binds to the receptor, a chain of
events is initiated that leads to the target cell’s response. Hormones play a critical role in the regulation of physiological
processesbecauseofthetargetcellresponsestheyregulate.Theseresponsescontributetohumanreproduction,growthand

Amine hormones are synthesized from the amino acids tryptophan or tyrosine. An example of a hormone derived from
tryptophan is melatonin, which is secreted by the pineal gland and helps regulate circadian rhythm. Tyrosine derivatives

Peptide and Protein Hormones
Whereastheaminehormonesarederivedfromasingleaminoacid,peptideandproteinhormonesconsistofmultipleamino
acids that link to form an amino acid chain. Peptide hormones consist of short chains of amino acids, whereas protein
hormones are longer polypeptides. Both types are synthesized like other body proteins: DNA is transcribed into mRNA,
which is translated into an amino acid chain.
Examples of peptide hormones include antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a pituitary hormone important in fluid balance, and
atrial-natriureticpeptide,whichisproducedbytheheartandhelpstodecreasebloodpressure.Someexamplesofprotein
hormones include growth hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),
whichhasanattachedcarbohydrategroupandisthusclassifiedasaglycoprotein.FSHhelpsstimulatethematurationof
eggs in the ovaries and sperm in the testes.
Steroid Hormones
The primary hormones derived from lipids are steroids. Steroid hormones are derived from the lipid cholesterol. For
example, the reproductive hormones testosterone and the estrogens—which are produced by the gonads (testes and
ovaries)—are steroid hormones. The adrenal glands produce the steroid hormone aldosterone, which is involved in
osmoregulation, and cortisol, which plays a role in metabolism.
Like cholesterol, steroid hormones are not soluble in water (they are hydrophobic). Because blood is water-based, lipid-
derived hormones must travel to their target cell bound to a transport protein. This more complex structure extends the
half-life of steroid hormones much longer than that of hormones derived from amino acids. A hormone’s half-life is the
timerequiredforhalftheconcentrationofthehormonetobedegraded.Forexample,thelipid-derivedhormonecortisolhas

of the cell membrane to reach the intracellular receptor (Figure 17.4). Thyroid hormones, which contain benzene rings
studded with iodine, are also lipid-soluble and can enter the cell.
The location of steroid and thyroid hormone binding differs slightly: a steroid hormone may bind to its receptor within
the cytosol or within the nucleus. In either case, this binding generates a hormone-receptor complex that moves toward
thechromatininthecellnucleusandbindstoaparticularsegmentofthecell’sDNA.Incontrast,thyroidhormonesbind
to receptors already bound to DNA. For both steroid and thyroid hormones, binding of the hormone-receptor complex
with DNA triggers transcription of a target gene to mRNA, which moves to the cytosol and directs protein synthesis by
ribosomes.

Pathways Involving Cell Membrane Hormone Receptors
Hydrophilic, or water-soluble, hormones are unable to diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and must
therefore pass on their message to a receptor located at the surface of the cell. Except for thyroid hormones, which are
lipid-soluble, all amino acid–derived hormones bind to cell membrane receptors that are located, at least in part, on the
extracellularsurfaceofthecellmembrane.Therefore,theydonotdirectlyaffectthetranscriptionoftargetgenes,butinstead
initiateasignalingcascadethatiscarriedoutbyamoleculecalledasecondmessenger.Inthiscase,thehormoneiscalled
afirst messenger.
The second messenger used by most hormones is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In the cAMP second
messenger system, a water-soluble hormone binds to its receptor in the cell membrane (Step 1 in Figure 17.5). This
receptor is associated with an intracellular component called a G protein, and binding of the hormone activates the G-
protein component (Step 2). The activated G protein in turn activates an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, also known as
adenylate cyclase (Step 3), which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP (Step 4). As the second messenger,
cAMPactivatesatypeofenzymecalledaproteinkinasethatispresentinthecytosol(Step5).Activatedproteinkinases
initiateaphosphorylationcascade,inwhichmultipleproteinkinasesphosphorylate(addaphosphategroupto)numerous
and various cellular proteins, including other enzymes (Step 6).
700 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM
Figure 17.5 Binding of Water-Soluble Hormones Water-soluble hormones cannot diffuse through the cell
membrane. These hormones must bind to a surface cell-membrane receptor. The receptor then initiates a cell-
signalingpathwaywithinthecellinvolvingGproteins,adenylylcyclase,thesecondarymessengercyclicAMP(cAMP),
and protein kinases. In the final step, these protein kinases phosphorylate proteins in the cytoplasm. This activates
proteins in the cell that carry out the changes specified by the hormone.
The phosphorylation of cellular proteins can trigger a wide variety of effects, from nutrient metabolism to the synthesis
ofdifferenthormonesandotherproducts.Theeffectsvaryaccordingtothetypeoftargetcell,theGproteinsandkinases
involved, and the phosphorylation of proteins. Examples of hormones that use cAMP as a second messenger include
calcitonin,whichisimportantforboneconstructionandregulatingbloodcalciumlevels;glucagon,whichplaysarolein
blood glucose levels; and thyroid-stimulating hormone, which causes the release of T3and T4from the thyroid gland.
Overall,thephosphorylationcascadesignificantlyincreasestheefficiency,speed,andspecificityofthehormonalresponse,
as thousands of signaling events can be initiated simultaneously in response to a very low concentration of hormone in
the bloodstream. However, the duration of the hormone signal is short, as cAMP is quickly deactivated by the enzyme
phosphodiesterase(PDE),whichislocatedinthecytosol.TheactionofPDEhelpstoensurethatatargetcell’sresponse
ceases quickly unless new hormones arrive at the cell membrane.
Importantly, there are also G proteins that decrease the levels of cAMP in the cell in response to hormone binding. For
example, when growth hormone–inhibiting hormone (GHIH), also known as somatostatin, binds to its receptors in the
pituitary gland, the level of cAMP decreases, thereby inhibiting the secretion of human growth hormone.
Not all water-soluble hormones initiate the cAMP second messenger system. One common alternative system uses
calcium ions as a second messenger. In this system, G proteins activate the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC), which
functionssimilarlytoadenylylcyclase.Onceactivated,PLCcleavesamembrane-boundphospholipidintotwomolecules:
diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). Like cAMP, DAG activates protein kinases that initiate a

a component of thyroid hormones, can therefore affect reproductive system development and functioning.

hormonesarerequiredforanadequateresponse.Forexample,twodifferentreproductivehormones—FSHfromthe
pituitary gland and estrogens from the ovaries—are required for the maturation of female ova (egg cells).
• The antagonistic effect, in which two hormones have opposing effects. A familiar example is the effect of two
pancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon. Insulin increases the liver’s storage of glucose as glycogen, decreasing
blood glucose, whereas glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen stores, increasing blood glucose.
Regulation of Hormone Secretion
To prevent abnormal hormone levels and a potential disease state, hormone levels must be tightly controlled. The body
maintains this control by balancing hormone production and degradation. Feedback loops govern the initiation and
maintenance of most hormone secretion in response to various stimuli.
Role of Feedback Loops
The contribution of feedback loops to homeostasis will only be briefly reviewed here. Positive feedback loops are
characterized by the release of additional hormone in response to an original hormone release. The release of oxytocin
duringchildbirthisapositivefeedbackloop.Theinitialreleaseofoxytocinbeginstosignaltheuterinemusclestocontract,
which pushes the fetus toward the cervix, causing it to stretch. This, in turn, signals the pituitary gland to release more
oxytocin, causing labor contractions to intensify. The release of oxytocin decreases after the birth of the child.
Themorecommonmethodofhormoneregulationisthenegativefeedbackloop.Negativefeedbackischaracterizedbythe
inhibitionoffurthersecretionofahormoneinresponsetoadequatelevelsofthathormone.Thisallowsbloodlevelsofthe
hormone to be regulated within a narrow range. An example of a negative feedback loop is the release of glucocorticoid
hormonesfromtheadrenalglands,asdirectedbythehypothalamusandpituitarygland.Asglucocorticoidconcentrations
in the blood rise, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland reduce their signaling to the adrenal glands to prevent additional
glucocorticoid secretion (Figure 17.6).
702 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM
Figure 17.6 Negative Feedback Loop The release of adrenal glucocorticoids is stimulated by the release of
hormones from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This signaling is inhibited when glucocorticoid levels become
elevated by causing negative signals to the pituitary gland and hypothalamus.

that control the secretion of a variety of pituitary hormones.
In addition to these chemical signals, hormones can also be released in response to neural stimuli. A common example
of neural stimuli is the activation of the fight-or-flight response by the sympathetic nervous system. When an individual
perceives danger, sympathetic neurons signal the adrenal glands to secrete norepinephrine and epinephrine. The two
hormones dilate blood vessels, increase the heart and respiratory rate, and suppress the digestive and immune systems.

Posterior Pituitary
The posterior pituitary is actually an extension of the neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the
hypothalamus. The cell bodies of these regions rest in the hypothalamus, but their axons descend as the
hypothalamic–hypophyseal tractwithintheinfundibulum,andendinaxonterminals thatcomprisetheposteriorpituitary

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 705
Figure 17.8 Posterior Pituitary Neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus release oxytocin (OT) or ADH into the
posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. These hormones are stored or released into the blood via the capillary plexus.
The posterior pituitary gland does not produce hormones, but rather stores and secretes hormones produced by the
hypothalamus. The paraventricular nuclei produce the hormone oxytocin, whereas the supraoptic nuclei produce ADH.
These hormones travel along the axons into storage sites in the axon terminals of the posterior pituitary. In response to
signals from the same hypothalamic neurons, the hormones are released from the axon terminals into the bloodstream.
Oxytocin
When fetal development is complete, the peptide-derived hormone oxytocin (tocia- = “childbirth”) stimulates uterine
contractionsanddilationofthecervix.Throughoutmostofpregnancy,oxytocinhormonereceptorsarenotexpressedathigh
levelsintheuterus.Towardtheendofpregnancy,thesynthesisofoxytocinreceptorsintheuterusincreases,andthesmooth
muscle cells of the uterus become more sensitive to its effects. Oxytocin is continually released throughout childbirth
through a positive feedback mechanism. As noted earlier, oxytocin prompts uterine contractions that push the fetal head
toward the cervix. In response, cervical stretching stimulates additional oxytocin to be synthesized by the hypothalamus
andreleasedfromthepituitary.Thisincreasestheintensityandeffectivenessofuterinecontractionsandpromptsadditional
dilation of the cervix. The feedback loop continues until birth.

contribute to parent–newborn bonding, known as attachment. Oxytocin is also thought to be involved in feelings of love
and closeness, as well as in the sexual response.
Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)

cells of the kidneys. Its effect is to increase epithelial permeability to water, allowing increased water reabsorption. The
more water reabsorbed from the filtrate, the greater the amount of water that is returned to the blood and the less that is
excreted in the urine. A greater concentration of water results in a reduced concentration of solutes. ADH is also known
asvasopressinbecause,inveryhighconcentrations,itcausesconstrictionofbloodvessels,whichincreasesbloodpressure
by increasing peripheral resistance. The release of ADH is controlled by a negative feedback loop. As blood osmolarity
decreases,thehypothalamicosmoreceptorssensethechangeandpromptacorrespondingdecreaseinthesecretionofADH.
As a result, less water is reabsorbed from the urine filtrate.
Interestingly, drugs can affect the secretion of ADH. For example, alcohol consumption inhibits the release of ADH,
resulting in increased urine production that can eventually lead to dehydration and a hangover. A disease called diabetes
insipidus is characterized by chronic underproduction of ADH that causes chronic dehydration. Because little ADH is
produced and secreted, not enough water is reabsorbed by the kidneys. Although patients feel thirsty, and increase their
fluidconsumption,thisdoesn’teffectivelydecreasethesoluteconcentrationintheirbloodbecauseADHlevelsarenothigh
enough to trigger water reabsorption in the kidneys. Electrolyte imbalances can occur in severe cases of diabetes insipidus.
Anterior Pituitary
The anterior pituitary originates from the digestive tract in the embryo and migrates toward the brain during fetal
development.Therearethreeregions:theparsdistalisisthemostanterior,theparsintermediaisadjacenttotheposterior
pituitary, and the pars tuberalis is a slender “tube” that wraps the infundibulum.
Recallthattheposteriorpituitarydoesnotsynthesizehormones,butmerelystoresthem.Incontrast,theanteriorpituitary
does manufacture hormones. However, the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary is regulated by two classes
ofhormones.Thesehormones—secretedbythehypothalamus—arethereleasinghormonesthatstimulatethesecretionof
hormones from the anterior pituitary and the inhibiting hormones that inhibit secretion.
Hypothalamic hormones are secreted by neurons, but enter the anterior pituitary through blood vessels (Figure 17.9).
Within the infundibulum is a bridge of capillaries that connects the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary. This network,
called the hypophyseal portal system, allows hypothalamic hormones to be transported to the anterior pituitary without
first entering the systemic circulation. The system originates from the superior hypophyseal artery, which branches off
the carotid arteries and transports blood to the hypothalamus. The branches of the superior hypophyseal artery form the
hypophyseal portal system (see Figure 17.9). Hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones travel through a primary
capillaryplexustotheportalveins,whichcarrythemintotheanteriorpituitary.Hormonesproducedbytheanteriorpituitary
(in response to releasing hormones) enter a secondary capillary plexus, and from there drain into the circulation.

Skeletal muscle and cartilage cells are particularly sensitive to stimulation from IGFs.
Dysfunction of the endocrine system’s control of growth can result in several disorders. For example, gigantism is a
disorder in children that is caused by the secretion of abnormally large amounts of GH, resulting in excessive growth. A
similar condition in adults is acromegaly, a disorder that results in the growth of bones in the face, hands, and feet in
responsetoexcessivelevelsofGHinindividualswhohavestoppedgrowing.AbnormallylowlevelsofGHinchildrencan
cause growth impairment—a disorder calledpituitary dwarfism(also known as growth hormone deficiency).
Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone
The activity of the thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), also called thyrotropin. TSH
is released from the anterior pituitary in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. As
discussed shortly, it triggers the secretion of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. In a classic negative feedback loop,
elevated levels of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream then trigger a drop in production of TRH and subsequently TSH.

follicles. The follicles are made up of a central cavity filled with a sticky fluid called colloid. Surrounded by a wall of
epithelial follicle cells, the colloid is the center of thyroid hormone production, and that production is dependent on the
hormones’ essential and unique component: iodine.

Synthesis and Release of Thyroid Hormones
Hormonesareproducedinthecolloidwhenatomsofthemineraliodineattachtoaglycoprotein,calledthyroglobulin,that
is secreted into the colloid by the follicle cells. The following steps outline the hormones’ assembly:
1. Binding of TSH to its receptors in the follicle cells of the thyroid gland causes the cells to actively transport iodide
ions (I–) across their cell membrane, from the bloodstream into the cytosol. As a result, the concentration of iodide
ions “trapped” in the follicular cells is many times higher than the concentration in the bloodstream.

3. In the colloid, peroxidase enzymes link the iodine to the tyrosine amino acids in thyroglobulin to produce two
intermediaries: a tyrosine attached to one iodine and a tyrosine attached to two iodines. When one of each of these
intermediariesislinkedbycovalentbonds,theresultingcompoundistriiodothyronine(T3),athyroidhormonewith
three iodines. Much more commonly, two copies of the second intermediary bond, forming tetraiodothyronine, also

Functions of Thyroid Hormones

Adequatelevelsofthyroidhormonesarealsorequiredforproteinsynthesisandforfetalandchildhoodtissuedevelopment
and growth. They are especially critical for normal development of the nervous system both in utero and in early
childhood, and they continue to support neurological function in adults. As noted earlier, these thyroid hormones have a
complex interrelationship with reproductive hormones, and deficiencies can influence libido, fertility, and other aspects
of reproductive function. Finally, thyroid hormones increase the body’s sensitivity to catecholamines (epinephrine and
norepinephrine) from the adrenal medulla by upregulation of receptors in the blood vessels. When levels of T3 and T4
hormones are excessive, this effect accelerates the heart rate, strengthens the heartbeat, and increases blood pressure.
Becausethyroidhormonesregulatemetabolism,heatproduction,proteinsynthesis,andmanyotherbodyfunctions,thyroid
disorders can have severe and widespread consequences.

Endocrine System: Iodine Deficiency, Hypothyroidism, and
Hyperthyroidism
Asdiscussedabove,dietaryiodineisrequiredforthesynthesisofT3andT4.Butformuchoftheworld’spopulation,
foods do not provide adequate levels of this mineral, because the amount varies according to the level in the soil in
which the food was grown, as well as the irrigation and fertilizers used. Marine fish and shrimp tend to have high
levelsbecausetheyconcentrateiodinefromseawater,butmanypeopleinlandlockedregionslackaccesstoseafood.
Thus,theprimarysourceofdietaryiodineinmanycountriesisiodizedsalt.Fortificationofsaltwithiodinebeganin
the United States in 1924, and international efforts to iodize salt in the world’s poorest nations continue today.
Dietary iodine deficiency can result in the impaired ability to synthesize T3 and T4, leading to a variety of severe
disorders. When T3 and T4 cannot be produced, TSH is secreted in increasing amounts. As a result of this
hyperstimulation, thyroglobulin accumulates in the thyroid gland follicles, increasing their deposits of colloid. The
accumulation of colloid increases the overall size of the thyroid gland, a condition called a goiter (Figure 17.14).
A goiter is only a visible indication of the deficiency. Other iodine deficiency disorders include impaired growth
anddevelopment,decreasedfertility,andprenatalandinfantdeath.Moreover,iodinedeficiencyistheprimarycause
of preventable mental retardation worldwide. Neonatal hypothyroidism (cretinism) is characterized by cognitive
deficits,shortstature,andsometimesdeafnessandmutenessinchildrenandadultsborntomotherswhowereiodine-

Figure 17.14Goiter(credit: “Almazi”/Wikimedia Commons)
In areas of the world with access to iodized salt, dietary deficiency is rare. Instead, inflammation of the thyroid
gland is the more common cause of low blood levels of thyroid hormones. Called hypothyroidism, the condition
is characterized by a low metabolic rate, weight gain, cold extremities, constipation, reduced libido, menstrual
irregularities, and reduced mental activity. In contrast, hyperthyroidism—an abnormally elevated blood level of
thyroidhormones—isoftencausedbyapituitaryorthyroidtumor.InGraves’disease,thehyperthyroidstateresults

The parathyroid glands produce and secrete PTH, a peptide hormone, in response to low blood calcium levels (Figure
17.16). PTH secretion causes the release of calcium from the bones by stimulating osteoclasts, which secrete enzymes
that degrade bone and release calcium into the interstitial fluid. PTH also inhibits osteoblasts, the cells involved in bone
deposition,therebysparingbloodcalcium.PTHcausesincreasedreabsorptionofcalcium(andmagnesium)inthekidney
tubules from the urine filtrate. In addition, PTH initiates the production of the steroid hormone calcitriol (also known as
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), which is the active form of vitamin D3, in the kidneys. Calcitriol then stimulates increased
absorption of dietary calcium by the intestines. A negative feedback loop regulates the levels of PTH, with rising blood
calcium levels inhibiting further release of PTH.

In contrast, abnormally low blood calcium levels may be caused by parathyroid hormone deficiency, called
hypoparathyroidism, which may develop following injury or surgery involving the thyroid gland. Low blood calcium
increases membrane permeability to sodium, resulting in muscle twitching, cramping, spasms, or convulsions. Severe
deficits can paralyze muscles, including those involved in breathing, and can be fatal.
Whenbloodcalciumlevelsarehigh,calcitoninisproducedandsecretedbytheparafollicularcellsofthethyroidgland.As
discussed earlier, calcitonin inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, reduces the absorption of dietary calcium in the intestine,
and signals the kidneys to reabsorb less calcium, resulting in larger amounts of calcium excreted in the urine.

Hormones of the Zona Glomerulosa
Themostsuperficialregionoftheadrenalcortexisthezonaglomerulosa,whichproducesagroupofhormonescollectively
referred to as mineralocorticoids because of their effect on body minerals, especially sodium and potassium. These
hormones are essential for fluid and electrolyte balance.
Aldosteroneisthemajormineralocorticoid.Itisimportantintheregulationoftheconcentrationofsodiumandpotassium
ions in urine, sweat, and saliva. For example, it is released in response to elevated blood K+, low blood Na+, low blood
pressure,orlowbloodvolume.Inresponse,aldosteroneincreasestheexcretionofK+andtheretentionofNa+,whichinturn
increases blood volume and blood pressure. Its secretion is prompted when CRH from the hypothalamus triggers ACTH
release from the anterior pituitary.
Aldosterone is also a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in which specialized cells of
the kidneys secrete the enzyme renin in response to low blood volume or low blood pressure. Renin then catalyzes the
conversion of the blood protein angiotensinogen, produced by the liver, to the hormone angiotensin I. Angiotensin I
is converted in the lungs to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II has three major
functions:
1. Initiating vasoconstriction of the arterioles, decreasing blood flow

2. Stimulating kidney tubules to reabsorb NaCl and water, increasing blood volume
3. Signalingtheadrenalcortextosecretealdosterone,theeffectsofwhichfurthercontributetofluidretention,restoring
blood pressure and blood volume
For individuals with hypertension, or high blood pressure, drugs are available that block the production of angiotensin
II. These drugs, known as ACE inhibitors, block the ACE enzyme from converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thus
mitigating the latter’s ability to increase blood pressure.
Hormones of the Zona Fasciculata
Theintermediateregionoftheadrenalcortexisthezonafasciculata,namedassuchbecausethecellsformsmallfascicles
(bundles) separated by tiny blood vessels. The cells of the zona fasciculata produce hormones called glucocorticoids
because of their role in glucose metabolism. The most important of these is cortisol, some of which the liver converts
to cortisone. A glucocorticoid produced in much smaller amounts is corticosterone. In response to long-term stressors,
thehypothalamus secretes CRH,whichinturntriggerstherelease ofACTHbytheanteriorpituitary.ACTHtriggersthe
release of the glucocorticoids. Their overall effect is to inhibit tissue building while stimulating the breakdown of stored
nutrientstomaintainadequatefuelsupplies.Inconditionsoflong-termstress,forexample,cortisolpromotesthecatabolism

of the immune system, which inhibits the inflammatory response.
Hormones of the Zona Reticularis
The deepest region of the adrenal cortex is the zona reticularis, which produces small amounts of a class of steroid sex
hormonescalledandrogens.Duringpubertyandmostofadulthood,androgensareproducedinthegonads.Theandrogens
produced in the zona reticularis supplement the gonadal androgens. They are produced in response to ACTH from the

sexdrive,buttheirfunctioninadultmenisnotwellunderstood.Inpost-menopausalwomen,asthefunctionsoftheovaries
decline, the main source of estrogens becomes the androgens produced by the zona reticularis.
Adrenal Medulla
As noted earlier, the adrenal cortex releases glucocorticoids in response to long-term stress such as severe illness. In
contrast, the adrenal medulla releases its hormones in response to acute, short-term stress mediated by the sympathetic
nervous system (SNS).
The medullary tissue is composed of unique postganglionic SNS neurons called chromaffin cells, which are large
and irregularly shaped, and produce the neurotransmitters epinephrine (also called adrenaline) and norepinephrine (or
noradrenaline).Epinephrineisproducedingreaterquantities—approximatelya4to1ratiowithnorepinephrine—andisthe
morepowerfulhormone.Becausethechromaffincellsreleaseepinephrineandnorepinephrineintothesystemiccirculation,
where they travel widely and exert effects on distant cells, they are considered hormones. Derived from the amino acid
tyrosine, they are chemically classified as catecholamines.
The secretion of medullary epinephrine and norepinephrine is controlled by a neural pathway that originates from the
hypothalamusinresponsetodangerorstress(theSAMpathway).Bothepinephrineandnorepinephrinesignaltheliverand

components of the immune system. Other effects include a dry mouth, loss of appetite, pupil dilation, and a loss of
peripheral vision. The major hormones of the adrenal glands are summarized inTable 17.5.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the location and structure of the pineal gland
• Discuss the function of melatonin

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 723
The secretion of melatonin may influence the body’s circadian rhythms, the dark-light fluctuations that affect not only
sleepiness and wakefulness, but also appetite and body temperature. Interestingly, children have higher melatonin levels
than adults, which may prevent the release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary, thereby inhibiting the onset of
puberty. Finally, an antioxidant role of melatonin is the subject of current research.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify the most important hormones produced by the testes and ovaries
• Name the hormones produced by the placenta and state their functions

but at a much reduced level. In addition, the testes produce the peptide hormone inhibin, which inhibits the secretion of
FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. FSH stimulates spermatogenesis.
Theprimaryhormonesproducedbytheovariesareestrogens,whichincludeestradiol,estriol,andestrone.Estrogensplay
an important role in a larger number of physiological processes, including the development of the female reproductive
system, regulation of the menstrual cycle, the development of female secondary sex characteristics such as increased

males—inhibitsthesecretionofFSH.Duringtheinitialstagesofpregnancy,anorgancalledtheplacentadevelopswithin
the uterus. The placenta supplies oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, excretes waste products, and produces and secretes
estrogens and progesterone. The placenta produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as well. The hCG hormone

Anabolic Steroids
The endocrine system can be exploited for illegal or unethical purposes. A prominent example of this is the use of
steroid drugs by professional athletes.
Commonly used for performance enhancement, anabolic steroids are synthetic versions of the male sex hormone,
testosterone.Byboostingnaturallevelsofthishormone,athletesexperienceincreasedmusclemass.Syntheticversions
of human growth hormone are also used to build muscle mass.

Cells and Secretions of the Pancreatic Islets
The pancreatic islets each contain four varieties of cells:
• Thealphacellproducesthehormoneglucagonandmakesupapproximately20percentofeachislet.Glucagonplays
an important role in blood glucose regulation; low blood glucose levels stimulate its release.
• The beta cell produces the hormone insulin and makes up approximately 75 percent of each islet. Elevated blood
glucose levels stimulate the release of insulin.
• Thedeltacellaccountsforfourpercentoftheisletcellsandsecretesthepeptidehormonesomatostatin.Recallthat
somatostatin is also released by the hypothalamus (as GHIH), and the stomach and intestines also secrete it. An

regulateboththestorageandtheutilizationofglucoseasrequired.Receptorslocatedinthepancreassensebloodglucose
levels, and subsequently the pancreatic cells secrete glucagon or insulin to maintain normal levels.
Glucagon
Receptors in the pancreas can sense the decline in blood glucose levels, such as during periods of fasting or during
prolonged labor or exercise (Figure 17.19). In response, the alpha cells of the pancreas secrete the hormone glucagon,
which has several effects:
• Itstimulatesthelivertoconvertitsstoresofglycogenbackintoglucose.Thisresponseisknownasglycogenolysis.
The glucose is then released into the circulation for use by body cells.
• Itstimulatesthelivertotakeupaminoacidsfromthebloodandconvertthemintoglucose.Thisresponseisknownas
gluconeogenesis.
• Itstimulateslipolysis,thebreakdownofstoredtriglyceridesintofreefattyacidsandglycerol.Someofthefreeglycerol

Taken together, these actions increase blood glucose levels. The activity of glucagon is regulated through a negative
feedback mechanism; rising blood glucose levels inhibit further glucagon production and secretion.

between 70 mg/dL and 110 mg/dL. If blood glucose concentration rises above this range, insulin is released, which
stimulates body cells to remove glucose from the blood. If blood glucose concentration drops below this range,
glucagon is released, which stimulates body cells to release glucose into the blood.

CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 727
The presence of food in the intestine triggers the release of gastrointestinal tract hormones such as glucose-dependent
insulinotropic peptide (previously known as gastric inhibitory peptide). This is in turn the initial trigger for insulin
production and secretion by the beta cells of the pancreas. Once nutrient absorption occurs, the resulting surge in blood
glucose levels further stimulates insulin secretion.

Insulin also reduces blood glucose levels by stimulating glycolysis, the metabolism of glucose for generation of ATP.

glycogenolysisandgluconeogenesis.Finally,insulinpromotestriglycerideandproteinsynthesis.Thesecretionofinsulin

Endocrine System: Diabetes Mellitus
Dysfunction of insulin production and secretion, as well as the target cells’ responsiveness to insulin, can lead to a
condition called diabetes mellitus. An increasingly common disease, diabetes mellitus has been diagnosed in more
than18millionadultsintheUnitedStates,andmorethan200,000children.Itisestimatedthatupto7millionmore
adults have the condition but have not been diagnosed. In addition, approximately 79 million people in the US are
estimatedtohavepre-diabetes,aconditioninwhichbloodglucoselevelsareabnormallyhigh,butnotyethighenough

for less than five percent of all diabetes cases.
Type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 95 percent of all cases. It is acquired, and lifestyle factors such as poor
diet, inactivity, and the presence of pre-diabetes greatly increase a person’s risk. About 80 to 90 percent of people
with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. In type 2 diabetes, cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. In

• Identify the organs with a secondary endocrine function, the hormone they produce, and its effects
Inyourstudyofanatomyandphysiology,youhavealreadyencountered afewofthemanyorgansofthebodythathave

Skeleton
Although bone has long been recognized as a target for hormones, only recently have researchers recognized that the
skeletonitselfproducesatleasttwohormones.Fibroblastgrowthfactor23(FGF23)isproducedbybonecellsinresponse
to increased blood levels of vitamin D3 or phosphate. It triggers the kidneys to inhibit the formation of calcitriol from
vitaminD3andtoincreasephosphorusexcretion.Osteocalcin,producedbyosteoblasts,stimulatesthepancreaticbetacells

isreleasedinresponsetofoodconsumptionandactsbybindingtobrainneuronsinvolvedinenergyintakeandexpenditure.
Binding of leptin produces a feeling of satiety after a meal, thereby reducing appetite. It also appears that the binding of
leptin to brain receptors triggers the sympathetic nervous system to regulate bone metabolism, increasing deposition of
cortical bone. Adiponectin—another hormone synthesized by adipose cells—appears to reduce cellular insulin resistance
andtoprotectbloodvesselsfrominflammationandatherosclerosis.Itslevelsarelowerinpeoplewhoareobese,andrise
following weight loss.

The liver is responsible for secreting at least four important hormones or hormone precursors: insulin-like growth factor
(somatomedin),angiotensinogen,thrombopoetin,andhepcidin.Insulin-likegrowthfactor-1istheimmediatestimulusfor

CHAPTER REVIEW
17.1An Overview of the Endocrine System
The endocrine system consists of cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones critical to homeostasis. The body
coordinatesitsfunctionsthroughtwomajortypesofcommunication:neuralandendocrine.Neuralcommunicationincludes
both electrical and chemical signaling between neurons and target cells. Endocrine communication involves chemical
signaling via the release of hormones into the extracellular fluid. From there, hormones diffuse into the bloodstream and
may travel to distant body regions, where they elicit a response in target cells. Endocrine glands are ductless glands that
secretehormones.Manyorgansofthebodywithotherprimaryfunctions—suchastheheart,stomach,andkidneys—also
have hormone-secreting cells.
17.2Hormones
Hormonesarederivedfromaminoacidsorlipids.Aminehormonesoriginatefromtheaminoacidstryptophanortyrosine.
Larger amino acid hormones include peptides and protein hormones. Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol.
Steroid hormones and thyroid hormone are lipid soluble. All other amino acid–derived hormones are water soluble.
Hydrophobic hormones are able to diffuse through the membrane and interact with an intracellular receptor. In contrast,

secretion or inhibition of a hormone.
17.3The Pituitary Gland and Hypothalamus
Thehypothalamus–pituitarycomplexislocatedinthediencephalonofthebrain.Thehypothalamusandthepituitarygland
are connected by a structure called the infundibulum, which contains vasculature and nerve axons. The pituitary gland
is divided into two distinct structures with different embryonic origins. The posterior lobe houses the axon terminals of
hypothalamic neurons. It stores and releases into the bloodstream two hypothalamic hormones: oxytocin and antidiuretic
hormone(ADH).Theanteriorlobeisconnectedtothehypothalamusbyvasculatureintheinfundibulumandproducesand
secretessixhormones.Theirsecretionisregulated,however,byreleasingandinhibitinghormonesfromthehypothalamus.
The six anterior pituitary hormones are: growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (PRL).
17.4The Thyroid Gland
The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located in the neck anterior to the trachea. Its hormones regulate basal
metabolism, oxygen use, nutrient metabolism, the production of ATP, and calcium homeostasis. They also contribute to
proteinsynthesisandthenormalgrowthanddevelopmentofbodytissues,includingmaturationofthenervoussystem,and
theyincreasethebody’ssensitivitytocatecholamines.Thethyroidhormonestriiodothyronine(T3)andthyroxine(T4)are
producedandsecretedbythethyroidglandinresponsetothyroid-stimulatinghormone(TSH)fromtheanteriorpituitary.
Synthesisoftheaminoacid–derivedT3andT4hormonesrequiresiodine.Insufficientamountsofiodineinthedietcanlead
to goiter, cretinism, and many other disorders.
17.5The Parathyroid Glands
Calcium is required for a variety of important physiologic processes, including neuromuscular functioning; thus, blood
calciumlevelsarecloselyregulated.Theparathyroidglandsaresmallstructureslocatedontheposteriorthyroidglandthat
produceparathyroidhormone(PTH),whichregulatesbloodcalciumlevels.Lowbloodcalciumlevelscausetheproduction
andsecretionofPTH.Incontrast,elevatedbloodcalciumlevelsinhibitsecretionofPTHandtriggersecretionofthethyroid
hormone calcitonin. Underproduction of PTH can result in hypoparathyroidism. In contrast, overproduction of PTH can
result in hyperparathyroidism.
17.6The Adrenal Glands
The adrenal glands, located superior to each kidney, consist of two regions: the adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. The
adrenal cortex—the outer layer of the gland—produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. The adrenal
medulla at the core of the gland produces epinephrine and norepinephrine.
Theadrenalglandsmediateashort-termstressresponseandalong-termstressresponse.Aperceivedthreatresultsinthe
secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, which mediate the fight-or-flight response. The
long-term stress response is mediated by the secretion of CRH from the hypothalamus, which triggers ACTH, which in
turnstimulatesthesecretionofcorticosteroidsfromtheadrenalcortex.Themineralocorticoids,chieflyaldosterone,cause
sodium and fluid retention, which increases blood volume and blood pressure.
17.7The Pineal Gland
The pineal gland is an endocrine structure of the diencephalon of the brain, and is located inferior and posterior to the
thalamus. It is made up of pinealocytes. These cells produce and secrete the hormone melatonin in response to low light
levels. High blood levels of melatonin induce drowsiness. Jet lag, caused by traveling across several time zones, occurs
because melatonin synthesis takes several days to readjust to the light-dark patterns in the new environment.
17.8Gonadal and Placental Hormones
The male and female reproductive system is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone
(LH)producedbytheanteriorlobeofthepituitaryglandinresponsetogonadotropin-releasinghormone(GnRH)fromthe
hypothalamus.Inmales,FSHstimulatesspermmaturation,whichisinhibitedbythehormoneinhibin.Thesteroidhormone
testosterone, a type of androgen, is released in response to LH and is responsible for the maturation and maintenance of
themalereproductivesystem,aswellasthedevelopmentofmalesecondarysexcharacteristics.Infemales,FSHpromotes
738 CHAPTER 17 | THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM
egg maturation and LH signals the secretion of the female sex hormones, the estrogens and progesterone. Both of these
hormones are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system, as well as maintaining
pregnancy. The placenta develops during early pregnancy, and secretes several hormones important for maintaining the
pregnancy.

bythealphacellsofthepancreasinresponsetolowbloodglucoselevels.Glucagonstimulatesmechanismsthatincrease
blood glucose levels, such as the catabolism of glycogen into glucose.
17.10Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions
Some organs have a secondary endocrine function. For example, the walls of the atria of the heart produce the hormone
atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), the gastrointestinal tract produces the hormones gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin,
whichaidindigestion,andthekidneysproduceerythropoietin (EPO),whichstimulates theformationofredbloodcells.
Even bone, adipose tissue, and the skin have secondary endocrine functions.
17.11Development and Aging of the Endocrine System
The endocrine system originates from all three germ layers of the embryo, including the endoderm, ectoderm, and
mesoderm. In general, different hormone classes arise from distinct germ layers. Aging affects the endocrine glands,
potentiallyaffectinghormoneproductionandsecretion,andcancausedisease.Theproductionofhormones,suchashuman
growth hormone, cortisol, aldosterone, sex hormones, and the thyroid hormones, decreases with age.

18.1 | An Overview of Blood
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify the primary functions of blood in transportation, defense, and maintenance of homeostasis
• Name the fluid component of blood and the three major types of formed elements, and identify their relative
proportions in a blood sample
• Discuss the unique physical characteristics of blood
• Identify the composition of blood plasma, including its most important solutes and plasma proteins
Recallthatbloodisaconnectivetissue.Likeallconnectivetissues,itismadeupofcellularelementsandanextracellular
matrix. The cellular elements—referred to as the formed elements—include red blood cells (RBCs), white blood
cells (WBCs), and cell fragments called platelets. The extracellular matrix, called plasma, makes blood unique among
connective tissues because it is fluid. This fluid, which is mostly water, perpetually suspends the formed elements and
enables them to circulate throughout the body within the cardiovascular system.
Functions of Blood
The primary function of blood is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to and remove wastes from body cells, but that is only
the beginning of the story. The specific functions of blood also include defense, distribution of heat, and maintenance of
homeostasis.
Transportation
Nutrientsfromthefoodsyoueatareabsorbedinthedigestivetract.Mostofthesetravelinthebloodstreamdirectlytothe
liver,wheretheyareprocessedandreleasedbackintothebloodstreamfordeliverytobodycells.Oxygenfromtheairyou
breathediffusesintotheblood,whichmovesfromthelungstotheheart,whichthenpumpsitouttotherestofthebody.
Moreover, endocrine glands scattered throughout the body release their products, called hormones, into the bloodstream,
whichcarriesthemtodistanttargetcells.Bloodalsopicksupcellularwastesandbyproducts,andtransportsthemtovarious
organsforremoval.Forinstance,bloodmovescarbondioxidetothelungsforexhalationfromthebody,andvariouswaste
products are transported to the kidneys and liver for excretion from the body in the form of urine or bile.
Defense
Many types of WBCs protect the body from external threats, such as disease-causing bacteria that have entered the
bloodstream in a wound. Other WBCs seek out and destroy internal threats, such as cells with mutated DNA that could
multiply to become cancerous, or body cells infected with viruses.

blood, about 45 percent of a sample is erythrocytes. The hematocrit of any one sample can vary significantly, however,
about 36–50 percent, according to gender and other factors. Normal hematocrit values for females range from 37 to 47,
withameanvalueof41;formales,hematocritrangesfrom42to52,withameanof47.Thepercentageofotherformed

The pH of blood averages about 7.4; however, it can range from 7.35 to 7.45 in a healthy person. Blood is therefore
somewhat more basic (alkaline) on a chemical scale than pure water, which has a pH of 7.0. Blood contains numerous
buffers that actually help to regulate pH.

Blood Plasma
Like other fluids in the body, plasma is composed primarily of water: In fact, it is about 92 percent water. Dissolved
or suspended within this water is a mixture of substances, most of which are proteins. There are literally hundreds of
substances dissolved or suspended in the plasma, although many of them are found only in very small quantities.

The three major groups of plasma proteins are as follows:
• Albuministhemostabundantoftheplasmaproteins.Manufacturedbytheliver,albuminmoleculesserveasbinding
proteins—transport vehicles forfattyacidsandsteroidhormones.Recall thatlipidsarehydrophobic;however,their
binding to albumin enables their transport in the watery plasma. Albumin is also the most significant contributor to
the osmotic pressure of blood; that is, its presence holds water inside the blood vessels and draws water from the
tissues, across blood vessel walls, and into the bloodstream. This in turn helps to maintain both blood volume and
bloodpressure.Albuminnormallyaccountsforapproximately54percentofthetotalplasmaproteincontent,inclinical

Other Plasma Solutes
In addition to proteins, plasma contains a wide variety of other substances. These include various electrolytes, such as
sodium, potassium, and calcium ions; dissolved gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen; various organic
nutrients,suchasvitamins,lipids,glucose,andaminoacids;andmetabolicwastes.Allofthesenonproteinsolutescombined

Phlebotomy and Medical Lab Technology
Phlebotomists are professionals trained to draw blood (phleb- = “a blood vessel”; -tomy = “to cut”). When more
than a few drops of blood are required, phlebotomists perform a venipuncture, typically of a surface vein in the
arm. They perform a capillary stick on a finger, an earlobe, or the heel of an infant when only a small quantity of
bloodisrequired. Anarterial stick iscollected fromanartery andusedtoanalyze bloodgases. After collection, the

body fluids, including blood. The information they provide is essential to the primary care providers in
determining a diagnosis and in monitoring the course of a disease and response to treatment.

whichthisreplacementoccursiscalledhemopoiesis,orhematopoiesis(fromtheGreekroothaima-=“blood”;-poiesis=

Sites of Hemopoiesis
Prior to birth, hemopoiesis occurs in a number of tissues, beginning with the yolk sac of the developing embryo,
and continuing in the fetal liver, spleen, lymphatic tissue, and eventually the red bone marrow. Following birth, most
hemopoiesisoccursintheredmarrow,aconnectivetissuewithinthespacesofspongy(cancellous)bonetissue.Inchildren,

epithelium, muscle, and nervous tissue. One step lower on the hierarchy of stem cells is the hemopoietic stem cell, or
hemocytoblast. All of the formed elements of blood originate from this specific type of cell.
Hemopoiesis begins when the hemopoietic stem cell is exposed to appropriate chemical stimuli collectively called
hemopoietic growth factors, which prompt it to divide and differentiate. One daughter cell remains a hemopoietic stem
cell,allowinghemopoiesistocontinue.Theotherdaughtercellbecomeseitheroftwotypesofmorespecializedstemcells

Figure 18.4 Hematopoietic System of Bone Marrow Hemopoiesis is the proliferation and differentiation of the
formed elements of blood.
Lymphoid and myeloid stem cells do not immediately divide and differentiate into mature formed elements. As you can
see in Figure 18.4, there are several intermediate stages of precursor cells (literally, forerunner cells), many of which
can be recognized by their names, which have the suffix -blast. For instance, megakaryoblasts are the precursors of
megakaryocytes, and proerythroblasts become reticulocytes, which eject their nucleus and most other organelles before
maturing into erythrocytes.
Hemopoietic Growth Factors
Development from stem cells to precursor cells to mature cells is again initiated by hemopoietic growth factors. These
include the following:

• Cytokinesareglycoproteinssecretedbyawidevarietyofcells,includingredbonemarrow,leukocytes,macrophages,
fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. They act locally as autocrine or paracrine factors, stimulating the proliferation of
progenitor cells and helping to stimulate both nonspecific and specific resistance to disease. There are two major
subtypes of cytokines known as colony-stimulating factors and interleukins.
◦ Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are glycoproteins that act locally, as autocrine or paracrine factors. Some
trigger the differentiation of myeloblasts into granular leukocytes, namely, neutrophils, eosinophils, and
basophils. These are referred to as granulocyte CSFs. A different CSF induces the production of monocytes,
calledmonocyteCSFs.BothgranulocytesandmonocytesarestimulatedbyGM-CSF;granulocytes,monocytes,
platelets,anderythrocytesarestimulatedbymulti-CSF.Syntheticformsofthesehormonesareoftenadministered
to patients with various forms of cancer who are receiving chemotherapy to revive their WBC counts.

Researchersnowsuspectthatinterleukinsmayplayotherrolesinbodyfunctioning,includingdifferentiationand

Blood Doping
Initsoriginalintent,thetermblooddopingwasusedtodescribethepracticeofinjectingbytransfusionsupplemental
RBCs into an individual, typically to enhance performance in a sport. Additional RBCs would deliver more oxygen
tothetissues,providingextraaerobiccapacity,clinicallyreferredtoasVO2max.Thesourceofthecellswaseither
from the recipient (autologous) or from a donor with compatible blood (homologous). This practice was aided by
thewell-developedtechniquesofharvesting,concentrating,andfreezingoftheRBCsthatcouldbelaterthawedand
injected, yet still retain their functionality. These practices are considered illegal in virtually all sports and run the
riskofinfection,significantlyincreasingtheviscosityofthebloodandthepotentialfortransmissionofblood-borne
pathogens if the blood was collected from another individual.
With the development of synthetic EPO in the 1980s, it became possible to provide additional RBCs by artificially
stimulatingRBCproductioninthebonemarrow.Originallydevelopedtotreatpatientssufferingfromanemia,renal
failure,orcancertreatment,largequantitiesofEPOcanbegeneratedbyrecombinantDNAtechnology.SyntheticEPO
is injected under the skin and can increase hematocrit for many weeks. It may also induce polycythemia and raise
hematocrit to 70 or greater. This increased viscosity raises the resistance of the blood and forces the heart to pump
more powerfully; in extreme cases, it has resulted in death. Other drugs such as cobalt II chloride have been shown
to increase natural EPO gene expression. Blood doping has become problematic in many sports, especially cycling.
Lance Armstrong, winner of seven Tour de France and many other cycling titles, was stripped of his victories and
admitted to blood doping in 2013.

Shape and Structure of Erythrocytes
As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow, it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles. During the
first day or two that it is in the circulation, an immature erythrocyte, known as a reticulocyte, will still typically contain
remnantsoforganelles.Reticulocytes shouldcompriseapproximately 1–2percentoftheerythrocytecountandprovidea
rough estimate of the rate of RBC production, with abnormally low or high rates indicating deviations in the production
of these cells. These remnants, primarily of networks (reticulum) of ribosomes, are quickly shed, however, and mature,

designated alpha 1 and 2, and beta 1 and 2 (Figure 18.7a). Each of these globin molecules is bound to a red pigment

In determining oxygenation of tissues, the value of greatest interest in healthcare is the percent saturation; that is, the
percentage of hemoglobin sites occupied by oxygen in a patient’s blood. Clinically this value is commonly referred to
simply as “percent sat.”
Percent saturation is normally monitored using a device known as a pulse oximeter, which is applied to a thin part of
the body, typically the tip of the patient’s finger. The device works by sending two different wavelengths of light (one
red, the other infrared) through the finger and measuring the light with a photodetector as it exits. Hemoglobin absorbs
light differentially depending upon its saturation with oxygen. The machine calibrates the amount of light received by
the photodetector against the amount absorbed by the partially oxygenated hemoglobin and presents the data as percent
saturation.Normalpulseoximeterreadingsrangefrom95–100percent.Lowerpercentagesreflecthypoxemia,orlowblood

productiontooccur,anumberofrawmaterialsmustbepresentinadequateamounts.Theseincludethesamenutrientsthat
areessentialtotheproductionandmaintenanceofanycell,suchasglucose,lipids,andaminoacids.However,erythrocyte
production also requires several trace elements:
• Iron. We have said that each heme group in a hemoglobin molecule contains an ion of the trace mineral iron. On
average,lessthan20percentoftheironweconsumeisabsorbed.Hemeiron,fromanimalfoodssuchasmeat,poultry,
and fish, is absorbed more efficiently than non-heme iron from plant foods. Upon absorption, iron becomes part of
the body’s total iron pool. The bone marrow, liver, and spleen can store iron in the protein compounds ferritin and
hemosiderin. Ferroportin transports the iron across the intestinal cell plasma membranes and from its storage sites
intotissuefluidwhereitenterstheblood.WhenEPOstimulatestheproductionoferythrocytes,ironisreleasedfrom
storage, bound to transferrin, and carried to the red marrow where it attaches to erythrocyte precursors.

Erythrocytes live up to 120 days in the circulation, after which the worn-out cells are removed by a type of myeloid
phagocyticcellcalledamacrophage,locatedprimarilywithinthebonemarrow,liver,andspleen.Thecomponentsofthe
degraded erythrocytes’ hemoglobin are further processed as follows:
• Globin, the protein portion of hemoglobin, is broken down into amino acids, which can be sent back to the bone

Figure 18.8 Erythrocyte Lifecycle Erythrocytes are produced in the bone marrow and sent into the circulation. At
the end of their lifecycle, they are destroyed by macrophages, and their components are recycled.
Disorders of Erythrocytes
The size, shape, and number of erythrocytes, and the number of hemoglobin molecules can have a major impact on a
person’shealth.WhenthenumberofRBCsorhemoglobinisdeficient,thegeneralconditioniscalledanemia.Thereare
more than 400 types of anemia and more than 3.5 million Americans suffer from this condition. Anemia can be broken
down into three major groups: those caused by blood loss, those caused by faulty or decreased RBC production, and
those caused by excessive destruction of RBCs. Clinicians often use two groupings in diagnosis: The kinetic approach

measuressize.Normal-sizedcellsarereferredtoasnormocytic,smaller-than-normalcellsarereferredtoasmicrocytic,and

The excessive use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen can trigger ulceration and
gastritis. Excessive menstruation and loss of blood during childbirth are also potential causes.
Anemias caused by faulty or decreased RBC production include sickle cell anemia, iron deficiency anemia, vitamin
deficiency anemia, and diseases of the bone marrow and stem cells.
• A characteristic change in the shape of erythrocytes is seen in sickle cell disease (also referred to as sickle cell
anemia). A genetic disorder, it is caused by production of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S,
whichdeliverslessoxygentotissuesandcauseserythrocytestoassumeasickle(orcrescent)shape,especiallyatlow
oxygen concentrations (Figure 18.9). These abnormally shaped cells can then become lodged in narrow capillaries
because they are unable to fold in on themselves to squeeze through, blocking blood flow to tissues and causing a
varietyofseriousproblemsfrompainfuljointstodelayedgrowthandevenblindnessandcerebrovascular accidents
(strokes). Sickle cell anemia is a genetic condition particularly found in individuals of African descent.

In contrast to anemia, an elevated RBC count is called polycythemia and is detected in a patient’s elevated hematocrit.
It can occur transiently in a person who is dehydrated; when water intake is inadequate or water losses are excessive,
the plasma volume falls. As a result, the hematocrit rises. For reasons mentioned earlier, a mild form of polycythemia is

18.4 | Leukocytes and Platelets
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the general characteristics of leukocytes
• Classify leukocytes according to their lineage, their main structural features, and their primary functions
• Discuss the most common malignancies involving leukocytes
• Identify the lineage, basic structure, and function of platelets
The leukocyte, commonly known as a white blood cell (or WBC), is a major component of the body’s defenses against
disease.LeukocytesprotectthebodyagainstinvadingmicroorganismsandbodycellswithmutatedDNA,andtheycleanup

factors for healing and repair. SeeFigure 18.5for a summary of leukocytes and platelets.
Characteristics of Leukocytes
Although leukocytes and erythrocytes both originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, they are very
different from each other in many significant ways. For instance, leukocytes are far less numerous than erythrocytes:
Typicallythereareonly5000to10,000perµL.Theyarealsolargerthanerythrocytesandaretheonlyformedelementsthat

typesofleukocytes.Mostofthesetypeshaveamuchshorterlifespanthanthatoferythrocytes,someasshortasafewhours
or even a few minutes in the case of acute infection.
One of the most distinctive characteristics of leukocytes is their movement. Whereas erythrocytes spend their days
circulating within the blood vessels, leukocytes routinely leave the bloodstream to perform their defensive functions in
thebody’stissues. Forleukocytes, thevascular networkissimply ahighwaytheytravel andsoonexit toreach their true
destination. When they arrive, they are often given distinct names, such as macrophage or microglia, depending on their
function.AsshowninFigure18.10,theyleavethecapillaries—thesmallestbloodvessels—orothersmallvesselsthrough
a process known as emigration (from the Latin for “removal”) or diapedesis (dia- = “through”; -pedan = “to leap”) in

leukocytes.Theyreleasechemicalsfromtheirgranulesthatdestroypathogens;theyarealsocapableofphagocytosis.
The monocyte, an agranular leukocyte, differentiates into a macrophage that then phagocytizes the pathogens.
Classification of Leukocytes
Whenscientistsfirstbegantoobservestainedbloodslides,itquicklybecameevidentthatleukocytescouldbedividedinto
two groups, according to whether their cytoplasm contained highly visible granules:
760 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD
• Granular leukocytes contain abundant granules within the cytoplasm. They include neutrophils, eosinophils, and
basophils (you can view their lineage from myeloid stem cells inFigure 18.4).
• While granules are not totally lacking in agranular leukocytes, they are far fewer and less obvious. Agranular
leukocytes include monocytes, which mature into macrophages that are phagocytic, and lymphocytes, which arise
from the lymphoid stem cell line.
Granular Leukocytes
Wewillconsiderthegranularleukocytesinorderfrommostcommontoleastcommon.Alloftheseareproducedinthered

which type of stain best highlights their granules (Figure 18.11).
Figure 18.11 Granular Leukocytes A neutrophil has small granules that stain light lilac and a nucleus with two to

A basophil has large granules that stain dark blue to purple and a two-lobed nucleus.

fine and normally appear light lilac. The nucleus has a distinct lobed appearance and may have two to five lobes, the
numberincreasingwiththeageofthecell.Olderneutrophilshaveincreasingnumbersoflobesandareoftenreferredtoas
polymorphonuclear(anucleuswithmanyforms),orsimply“polys.”Youngerandimmatureneutrophilsbegintodevelop

but are also found in burn patients and others experiencing unusual stress. A burn injury increases the proliferation of

eosinophils stainbestwithanacidic stainknownaseosin.Thenucleusoftheeosinophilwilltypically havetwotothree
lobes and, if stained properly, the granules will have a distinct red to orange color.
Thegranulesofeosinophilsincludeantihistamine molecules, whichcounteract theactivities ofhistamines, inflammatory
chemicals produced by basophils and mast cells. Some eosinophil granules contain molecules toxic to parasitic worms,
which can enter the body through the integument, or when an individual consumes raw or undercooked fish or meat.
Eosinophils are also capable of phagocytosis and are particularly effective when antibodies bind to the target and form
an antigen-antibody complex. High counts of eosinophils are typical of patients experiencing allergies, parasitic worm
infestations, and some autoimmune diseases. Low counts may be due to drug toxicity and stress.
Basophilsaretheleastcommonleukocytes,typicallycomprisinglessthanonepercentofthetotalleukocytecount.They

lymphocytes and monocytes (seeFigure 18.4).

smallercellsaretypically6–9µmwithalargervolumeofnucleustocytoplasm,creatinga“halo”effect.Afewcellsmay
fall outside these ranges, at 14–17µm. This finding has led to the three size range classification.
The three major groups of lymphocytes include natural killer cells, B cells, and T cells. Natural killer (NK) cells are
capable of recognizing cells that do not express “self” proteins on their plasma membrane or that contain foreign or
abnormal markers. These “nonself” cells include cancer cells, cells infected with a virus, and other cells with atypical
surface proteins. Thus, they provide generalized, nonspecific immunity. The larger lymphocytes are typically NK cells.
B cells and T cells, also called B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes, play prominent roles in defending the body against
specificpathogens(disease-causingmicroorganisms)andareinvolvedinspecificimmunity.OneformofBcells(plasma
cells) produces the antibodies or immunoglobulins that bind to specific foreign or abnormal components of plasma

Abnormally high counts of monocytes are associated with viral or fungal infections, tuberculosis, and some forms of
leukemia and other chronic diseases. Abnormally low counts are typically caused by suppression of the bone marrow.
Lifecycle of Leukocytes
Mostleukocyteshavearelativelyshortlifespan,typicallymeasuredinhoursordays.Productionofallleukocytesbegins
in the bone marrow under the influence of CSFs and interleukins. Secondary production and maturation of lymphocytes
occursinspecificregionsoflymphatictissueknownasgerminalcenters.Lymphocytesarefullycapableofmitosisandmay

Leukemia is a cancer involving an abundance of leukocytes. It may involve only one specific type of leukocyte from
either the myeloid line (myelocytic leukemia) orthe lymphoid line (lymphocytic leukemia). Inchronic leukemia, mature
leukocytesaccumulateandfailtodie.Inacuteleukemia,thereisanoverproductionofyoung,immatureleukocytes.Inboth

quickly and require aggressive treatment, without which they are rapidly fatal.
762 CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD
Platelets
You may occasionally see platelets referred to as thrombocytes, but because this name suggests they are a type of cell,
it is not accurate. A platelet is not a cell but rather a fragment of the cytoplasm of a cell called a megakaryocyte that is
surroundedbyaplasmamembrane.Megakaryocytesaredescendedfrommyeloidstemcells(seeFigure18.4)andarelarge,

Platelets are relatively small, 2–4 µm in diameter, but numerous, with typically 150,000–160,000 per µL of blood. After

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the three mechanisms involved in hemostasis
• Explain how the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways lead to the common pathway, and the coagulation
factors involved in each
• Discuss disorders affecting hemostasis

Clotting Factors Involved in Coagulation
In the coagulation cascade, chemicals called clotting factors (or coagulation factors) prompt reactions that activate still
more coagulation factors. The process is complex, but is initiated along two basic pathways:
• The extrinsic pathway, which normally is triggered by trauma.
• The intrinsic pathway, which begins in the bloodstream and is triggered by internal damage to the wall of the vessel.
Bothofthesemergeintoathirdpathway,referredtoasthecommonpathway(seeFigure18.14b).Allthreepathwaysare

Extrinsic Pathway
The quicker responding and more direct extrinsic pathway (also known as the tissue factor pathway) begins when
damage occurs to the surrounding tissues, such as in a traumatic injury. Upon contact with blood plasma, the damaged
extravascularcells,whichareextrinsictothebloodstream,releasefactorIII(thromboplastin).Sequentially,Ca2+thenfactor

the insoluble fibrinogen, into the soluble fibrin protein strands. Factor XIII then stabilizes the fibrin clot.
Fibrinolysis
The stabilized clot is acted upon by contractile proteins within the platelets. As these proteins contract, they pull on the
fibrin threads, bringing the edges of the clot more tightly together, somewhat as we do when tightening loose shoelaces
(seeFigure18.14a).Thisprocessalsowringsoutoftheclotasmallamountoffluidcalledserum,whichisbloodplasma
without its clotting factors.
To restore normal blood flow as the vessel heals, the clot must eventually be removed. Fibrinolysis is the gradual
degradation of the clot. Again, there is a fairly complicated series of reactions that involves factor XII and protein-
catabolizing enzymes. During this process, the inactive protein plasminogen is converted into the active plasmin, which
graduallybreaksdownthefibrinoftheclot.Additionally,bradykinin,avasodilator,isreleased,reversingtheeffectsofthe

Plasma Anticoagulants
An anticoagulant is any substance that opposes coagulation. Several circulating plasma anticoagulants play a role in
limitingthecoagulationprocesstotheregionofinjuryandrestoringanormal,clot-freeconditionofblood.Forinstance,
a cluster of proteins collectively referred to as the protein C system inactivates clotting factors involved in the intrinsic
pathway.TFPI(tissuefactorpathwayinhibitor)inhibitstheconversionoftheinactivefactorVIItotheactiveforminthe
extrinsic pathway. Antithrombin inactivates factor X and opposes the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin
in the common pathway. And as noted earlier, basophils release heparin, a short-acting anticoagulant that also opposes
prothrombin.Heparinisalsofoundonthesurfacesofcellsliningthebloodvessels.Apharmaceuticalformofheparinis

Disorders of Clotting
Either an insufficient or an excessive production of platelets can lead to severe disease or death. As discussed earlier, an
insufficientnumberofplatelets,calledthrombocytopenia,typicallyresultsintheinabilityofbloodtoformclots.Thiscan
lead to excessive bleeding, even from minor wounds.
Another reason for failure of the blood to clot is the inadequate production of functional amounts of one or more
clotting factors. This is the case in the genetic disorder hemophilia, which is actually a group of related disorders, the
most common of which is hemophilia A, accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases. This disorder results in the
inability to synthesize sufficient quantities of factor VIII. Hemophilia B is the second most common form, accounting
for approximately 20 percent of cases. In this case, there is a deficiency of factor IX. Both of these defects are linked to
the X chromosome and are typically passed from a healthy (carrier) mother to her male offspring, since males are XY.
Femaleswouldneedtoinheritadefectivegenefromeachparenttomanifestthedisease,sincetheyareXX.Patientswith
hemophilia bleed from even minor internal and external wounds, and leak blood into joint spaces after exercise and into
urine and stool. Hemophilia C is a rare condition that is triggered by an autosomal (not sex) chromosome that renders

A class of drugs collectively known as thrombolytic agents can help speed up the degradation of an abnormal clot. If
a thrombolytic agent is administered to a patient within 3 hours following a thrombotic stroke, the patient’s prognosis
improves significantly. However, some strokes are not caused by thrombi, but by hemorrhage. Thus, the cause must
be determined before treatment begins. Tissue plasminogen activator is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of

CHAPTER 18 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD 769
Blood transfusions in humans were risky procedures until the discovery of the major human blood groups by Karl
Landsteiner, an Austrian biologist and physician, in 1900. Until that point, physicians did not understand that death
sometimes followedbloodtransfusions,whenthetypeofdonorbloodinfusedintothepatient wasincompatible withthe
patient’sownblood.Bloodgroupsaredeterminedbythepresenceorabsenceofspecificmarkermoleculesontheplasma
membranesoferythrocytes.Withtheirdiscovery,itbecamepossibleforthefirsttimetomatchpatient-donorbloodtypes
and prevent transfusion reactions and deaths.
Antigens, Antibodies, and Transfusion Reactions
Antigensaresubstancesthatthebodydoesnotrecognizeasbelongingtothe“self”andthatthereforetriggeradefensive
response from the leukocytes of the immune system. (Seek more content for additional information on immunity.) Here,
we will focus onthe role ofimmunity inbloodtransfusion reactions. With RBCs inparticular,youmay see the antigens
referredtoasisoantigensoragglutinogens(surfaceantigens)andtheantibodiesreferredtoasisoantibodiesoragglutinins.
In this chapter, we will use the more common terms antigens and antibodies.
Antigens are generally large proteins, but may include other classes of organic molecules, including carbohydrates,
lipids, and nucleic acids. Following an infusion of incompatible blood, erythrocytes with foreign antigens appear in the
bloodstreamandtriggeranimmuneresponse.Proteinscalledantibodies(immunoglobulins),whichareproducedbycertain
Blymphocytescalledplasmacells,attachtotheantigensontheplasmamembranesoftheinfusederythrocytesandcause
them to adhere to one another.
• BecausethearmsoftheY-shapedantibodiesattachrandomlytomorethanonenonselferythrocytesurface,theyform
clumps of erythrocytes. This process is calledagglutination.
• The clumps of erythrocytes block small blood vessels throughout the body, depriving tissues of oxygen and nutrients.
• As the erythrocyte clumps are degraded, in a process called hemolysis, their hemoglobin is released into the
bloodstream.Thishemoglobintravelstothekidneys,whichareresponsibleforfiltrationoftheblood.However,the

Morethan50antigenshavebeenidentifiedonerythrocytemembranes,butthemostsignificantintermsoftheirpotential
harm to patients are classified in two groups: the ABO blood group and the Rh blood group.

are designated blood type O. ABO blood types are genetically determined.
Normallythebodymustbeexposedtoaforeignantigenbeforeanantibodycanbeproduced.Thisisnotthecaseforthe
ABO blood group. Individuals with type A blood—without any prior exposure to incompatible blood—have preformed
antibodiestotheBantigencirculatingintheirbloodplasma.Theseantibodies,referredtoasanti-Bantibodies,willcause
agglutination and hemolysis if they ever encounter erythrocytes with B antigens. Similarly, an individual with type B
bloodhaspre-formedanti-Aantibodies.IndividualswithtypeABblood,whichhasbothantigens,donothavepreformed
antibodies to either of these. People with type O blood lack antigens A and B on their erythrocytes, but both anti-A and
anti-B antibodies circulate in their blood plasma.
Rh Blood Groups
The Rhblood groupis classified according to the presence orabsence ofa second erythrocyte antigen identified as Rh.
(Itwasfirstdiscoveredinatypeofprimateknownasarhesusmacaque,whichisoftenusedinresearch,becauseitsblood
is similar to that of humans.) Although dozens of Rh antigens have been identified, only one, designated D, is clinically
important.ThosewhohavetheRhDantigenpresentontheirerythrocytes—about85percentofAmericans—aredescribed
asRhpositive(Rh+)andthosewholackitareRhnegative(Rh−).NotethattheRhgroupisdistinctfromtheABOgroup,
soanyindividual,nomattertheirABObloodtype,mayhaveorlackthisRhantigen.Whenidentifyingapatient’sblood

Rh antigen.

In contrast to the ABO group antibodies, which are preformed, antibodies to the Rh antigen are produced only in Rh−
individuals after exposure to the antigen. This process, called sensitization, occurs following a transfusion with Rh-
incompatible blood or, more commonly, with the birth of an Rh+ baby to an Rh− mother. Problems are rare in a first
pregnancy,sincethebaby’sRh+cellsrarelycrosstheplacenta(theorganofgasandnutrientexchangebetweenthebaby
and the mother). However, during or immediately after birth, the Rh− mother can be exposed to the baby’s Rh+ cells
(Figure 18.15). Research has shown that this occurs in about 13−14 percent of such pregnancies. After exposure, the

defendthebodyagainstinfectionandotherthreats;andtothehomeostaticregulationofpH,temperature,andotherinternal
conditions. Blood is composed of formed elements—erythrocytes, leukocytes, and cell fragments called platelets—and
a fluid extracellular matrix called plasma. More than 90 percent of plasma is water. The remainder is mostly plasma

Introduction
Chapter Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Identify and describe the interior and exterior parts of the human heart
• Describe the path of blood through the cardiac circuits
• Describe the size, shape, and location of the heart
• Compare cardiac muscle to skeletal and smooth muscle
• Explain the cardiac conduction system
• Describe the process and purpose of an electrocardiogram
• Explain the cardiac cycle
• Calculate cardiac output
784 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART
• Describe the effects of exercise on cardiac output and heart rate
• Name the centers of the brain that control heart rate and describe their function
• Identify other factors affecting heart rate
• Describe fetal heart development
In this chapter, you will explore the remarkable pump that propels the blood into the vessels. There is no single better

intothemajorvessels:theaortaandpulmonarytrunk.Fromthesevessels,thebloodisdistributedtotheremainderofthe
body.Althoughtheconnotationoftheterm“pump”suggestsamechanicaldevicemadeofsteelandplastic,theanatomical
structure is a living, sophisticated muscle. As you read this chapter, try to keep these twin concepts in mind: pump and
muscle.
Although the term “heart” is an English word, cardiac (heart-related) terminology can be traced back to the Latin term,
“kardia.” Cardiology is the study of the heart, and cardiologists are the physicians who deal primarily with the heart.
19.1 | Heart Anatomy
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the location and position of the heart within the body cavity
• Describe the internal and external anatomy of the heart
• Identify the tissue layers of the heart
• Relate the structure of the heart to its function as a pump
• Compare systemic circulation to pulmonary circulation
• Identify the veins and arteries of the coronary circulation system
• Trace the pathway of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood thorough the chambers of the heart

Chambers and Circulation through the Heart
Thehumanheartconsistsoffourchambers:Theleftsideandtherightsideeachhaveoneatriumandoneventricle.Each
of the upper chambers, the right atrium (plural = atria) and the left atrium, acts as a receiving chamber and contracts to
pushbloodintothelowerchambers,therightventricleandtheleftventricle.Theventriclesserveastheprimarypumping
chambers of the heart, propelling blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body.
There are two distinct but linked circuits in the human circulation called the pulmonary and systemic circuits. Although
both circuits transport blood and everything it carries, we can initially view the circuits from the point of view of gases.
Thepulmonarycircuittransportsbloodtoandfromthelungs,whereitpicksupoxygenanddeliverscarbondioxidefor
exhalation.Thesystemiccircuittransportsoxygenatedbloodtovirtuallyallofthetissuesofthebodyandreturnsrelatively
deoxygenated blood and carbon dioxide to the heart to be sent back to the pulmonary circulation.
Therightventriclepumpsdeoxygenatedbloodintothepulmonarytrunk,whichleadstowardthelungsandbifurcatesinto
theleftandrightpulmonaryarteries.Thesevesselsinturnbranchmanytimesbeforereachingthepulmonarycapillaries,
where gas exchange occurs: Carbon dioxide exits the blood and oxygen enters. The pulmonary trunk arteries and their
branches are the only arteries in the post-natal body that carry relatively deoxygenated blood. Highly oxygenated blood
returning from the pulmonary capillaries in the lungs passes through a series of vessels that join together to form the
pulmonaryveins—theonlypost-natalveinsinthebodythatcarryhighlyoxygenatedblood.Thepulmonaryveinsconduct
blood into the left atrium, which pumps the blood into the left ventricle, which in turn pumps oxygenated blood into the
aorta and on to the many branches of the systemic circuit. Eventually, these vessels will lead to the systemic capillaries,
where exchange with the tissue fluid and cells of the body occurs. In this case, oxygen and nutrients exit the systemic
capillaries to be used by the cells in their metabolic processes, and carbon dioxide and waste products will enter the blood.
The blood exiting the systemic capillaries is lower in oxygen concentration than when it entered. The capillaries will
ultimatelyunitetoformvenules,joiningtoformever-largerveins,eventuallyflowingintothetwomajorsystemicveins,
the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava, which return blood to the right atrium. The blood in the superior
and inferior venae cavae flows into the right atrium, which pumps blood into the right ventricle. This process of blood
circulationcontinuesaslongastheindividualremainsalive.Understandingtheflowofbloodthroughthepulmonaryand
systemic circuits is critical to all health professions (Figure 19.4).

Membranes, Surface Features, and Layers
Our exploration of more in-depth heart structures begins by examining the membrane that surrounds the heart, the

own unique role in terms of function.

literally translates as “around the heart,” consists of two distinct sublayers: the sturdy outer fibrous pericardium and the
inner serous pericardium. The fibrous pericardium is made of tough, dense connective tissue that protects the heart and
maintainsitspositioninthethorax.Themoredelicateserouspericardiumconsistsoftwolayers:theparietalpericardium,

vasodilators.
Internal Structure of the Heart
Recall that the heart’s contraction cycle follows a dual pattern of circulation—the pulmonary and systemic
circuits—because of the pairs of chambers that pump blood into the circulation. In order to develop a more precise
understanding of cardiac function, it is first necessary to explore the internal anatomical structures in more detail.
Septa of the Heart
ThewordseptumisderivedfromtheLatinfor“somethingthatencloses;”inthiscase,aseptum(plural=septa)refersto
a wall or partition that divides the heart into chambers. The septa are physical extensions of the myocardium lined with
endocardium. Located betweenthetwoatriaistheinteratrial septum.Normallyinanadultheart,theinteratrial septum

one-way flow of blood. The valves between the atria and ventricles are known generically as atrioventricular valves.
The valves at the openings that lead to the pulmonary trunk and aorta are known generically as semilunar valves. The
interventricular septum is visible in Figure 19.9. In this figure, the atrioventricular septum has been removed to better

Heart: Heart Defects
One very common form of interatrial septum pathology is patent foramen ovale, which occurs when the septum
primumdoesnotcloseatbirth,andthefossaovalisisunabletofuse.ThewordpatentisfromtheLatinrootpatensfor
“open.”Itmaybebenignorasymptomatic,perhapsneverbeingdiagnosed,orinextremecases,itmayrequiresurgical
repair to close the opening permanently. As much as 20–25 percent of the general population may have a patent
foramenovale,butfortunately,mosthavethebenign,asymptomaticversion.Patentforamenovaleisnormallydetected
by auscultation of a heart murmur (an abnormal heart sound) and confirmed by imaging with an echocardiogram.

poorappetite,troublefeeding,orfailuretothrive.Inolderindividuals,symptomsincludedizziness,fainting,shortness
of breath, chest pain, fatigue, headache, and nosebleeds. Treatment involves surgery to resect (remove) the affected
region or angioplasty to open the abnormally narrow passageway. Studies have shown that the earlier the surgery is
performed, the better the chance of survival.
A patent ductus arteriosus is a congenital condition in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close. The condition may
rangefromseveretobenign.Failureoftheductusarteriosustocloseresultsinbloodflowingfromthehigherpressure
aorta into the lower pressure pulmonary trunk. This additional fluid moving toward the lungs increases pulmonary
pressure and makes respiration difficult. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), tachycardia, enlarged
heart, a widened pulse pressure, and poor weight gain in infants. Treatments include surgical closure (ligation),
manualclosureusingplatinumcoilsorspecializedmeshinsertedviathefemoralarteryorvein,ornonsteroidalanti-
inflammatory drugs to block the synthesis of prostaglandin E2, which maintains the vessel in an open position. If
untreated, the condition can result in congestive heart failure.
Septal defects are not uncommon in individuals and may be congenital or caused by various disease processes.

Right Ventricle
The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve. Each flap of the valve is attached
to strong strands of connective tissue, the chordae tendineae, literally “tendinous cords,” or sometimes more poetically
referredtoas“heartstrings.”Thereareseveralchordaetendineaeassociatedwitheachoftheflaps.Theyarecomposedof

Left Atrium
After exchange of gases in the pulmonary capillaries, blood returns to the left atrium high in oxygen via one of the
four pulmonary veins. While the left atrium does not contain pectinate muscles, it does have an auricle that includes
thesepectinateridges.Bloodflowsnearlycontinuouslyfromthepulmonaryveinsbackintotheatrium,whichactsasthe

is no moderator band. The mitral valve is connected to papillary muscles via chordae tendineae. There are two papillary
muscles on the left—the anterior and posterior—as opposed to three on the right.
The left ventricle is the major pumping chamber for the systemic circuit; it ejects blood into the aorta through the aortic
semilunar valve.
Heart Valve Structure and Function

muscles or chordae tendineae associated with the pulmonary valve.
Located at the opening between the left atrium and left ventricle is the mitral valve, also called the bicuspid valve or
the left atrioventricular valve. Structurally, this valve consists of two cusps, known as the anterior medial cusp and the
posterior medial cusp, compared to the three cusps of the tricuspid valve. In a clinical setting, the valve is referred to as
themitralvalve,ratherthanthebicuspidvalve.Thetwocuspsofthemitralvalveareattachedbychordaetendineaetotwo
papillary muscles that project from the wall of the ventricle.
At the base of the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve, or the aortic valve, which prevents backflow from the aorta. It
normallyiscomposedofthreeflaps.Whentheventriclerelaxesandbloodattemptstoflowbackintotheventriclefromthe
aorta, blood will fill the cusps of the valve, causing it to close and producing an audible sound.

When the mitral valve is open, it allows blood to move from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The aortic semilunar
valve is closed to prevent backflow of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle.
Figure 19.14a shows the atrioventricular valves closed while the two semilunar valves are open. This occurs when the
ventricles contract to eject blood into the pulmonary trunk and aorta. Closure of the two atrioventricular valves prevents
blood from being forced back into the atria. This stage can be seen from a frontal view inFigure 19.14b.

Cardiologist
Cardiologists are medical doctors that specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the heart. After
completing 4 years of medical school, cardiologists complete a three-year residency in internal medicine followed
by an additional three or more years in cardiology. Following this 10-year period of medical training and clinical
experience, they qualify for a rigorous two-day examination administered by the Board of Internal Medicine that
tests their academic training and clinical abilities, including diagnostics and treatment. After successful completion
of this examination, a physician becomes a board-certified cardiologist. Some board-certified cardiologists may
be invited to become a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology (FACC). This professional recognition is
awardedtooutstandingphysiciansbaseduponmerit,includingoutstandingcredentials,achievements,andcommunity
contributions to cardiovascular medicine.

An MI can be confirmed by examining the patient’s ECG, which frequently reveals alterations in the ST and Q
components.SomeclassificationschemesofMIarereferredtoasST-elevatedMI(STEMI)andnon-elevatedMI(non-
STEMI). In addition, echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be employed. Common blood
tests indicating an MI include elevated levels of creatine kinase MB (an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of
creatine to phosphocreatine, consuming ATP) and cardiac troponin (the regulatory protein for muscle contraction),
both of which are released by damaged cardiac muscle cells.
Immediate treatments for MI are essential and include administering supplemental oxygen, aspirin that helps to
break up clots, and nitroglycerine administered sublingually (under the tongue) to facilitate its absorption. Despite
itsunquestionedsuccessintreatmentsandusesincethe1880s,themechanismofnitroglycerineisstillincompletely

Coronary Veins
Coronary veins drain the heart and generally parallel the large surface arteries (see Figure 19.15). The great cardiac
vein can be seen initially on the surface of the heart following the interventricular sulcus, but it eventually flows along
the coronary sulcus into the coronary sinus on the posterior surface. The great cardiac vein initially parallels the anterior

There are two major types of cardiac muscle cells: myocardial contractile cells and myocardial conducting cells. The
myocardialcontractilecellsconstitutethebulk(99percent)ofthecellsintheatriaandventricles.Contractilecellsconduct
impulses and are responsible for contractions that pump blood through the body. The myocardial conducting cells (1
percent of the cells) form the conduction system of the heart. Except for Purkinje cells, they are generally much smaller
than the contractile cells and have few of the myofibrils or filaments needed for contraction. Their function is similar in

cardiomyocytes have a single, central nucleus, but two or more nuclei may be found in some cells.
Cardiac muscle cells branch freely. A junction between two adjoining cells is marked by a critical structure called an

Repair and Replacement
Damaged cardiac muscle cells have extremely limited abilities to repair themselves or to replace dead cells via
mitosis. Recent evidence indicates that at least some stem cells remain within the heart that continue to divide and
at least potentially replace these dead cells. However, newly formed or repaired cells are rarely as functional as the
original cells, and cardiac function is reduced. In the event of a heart attack or MI, dead cells are often replaced
by patches of scar tissue. Autopsies performed on individuals who had successfully received heart transplants show
some proliferation of original cells. If researchers can unlock the mechanism that generates new cells and restore
full mitotic capabilities to heart muscle, the prognosis for heart attack survivors will be greatly enhanced. To date,

Conduction System of the Heart
If embryonic heart cells are separated into a Petri dish and kept alive, each is capable of generating its own electrical
impulse followed by contraction. When two independently beating embryonic cardiac muscle cells are placed together,
the cell with the higher inherent rate sets the pace, and the impulse spreads from the faster to the slower cell to trigger a
contraction.Asmorecellsarejoinedtogether,thefastestcellcontinuestoassumecontroloftherate.Afullydevelopedadult

middle,andposterior)thatleaddirectlyfromtheSAnodetothenextnodeintheconductionsystem,theatrioventricular
node (see Figure 19.18). The impulse takes approximately 50 ms (milliseconds) to travel between these two nodes. The
relative importance of this pathway has been debated since the impulse would reach the atrioventricular node simply
following the cell-by-cell pathway through the contractile cells of the myocardium in the atria. In addition, there is a
specializedpathwaycalledBachmann’sbundleortheinteratrialbandthatconductstheimpulsedirectlyfromtheright

Atrioventricular Bundle (Bundle of His), Bundle Branches, and Purkinje Fibers
Arising from the AV node, the atrioventricular bundle, or bundle of His, proceeds through the interventricular septum
beforedividingintotwoatrioventricularbundlebranches,commonlycalledtheleftandrightbundlebranches.Theleft
bundle branch has two fascicles. The left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and the right bundle branch the right
ventricle. Since the left ventricle is much larger than the right, the left bundle branch is also considerably larger than the
right.Portionsoftherightbundlebrancharefoundinthemoderatorbandandsupplytherightpapillarymuscles.Because
of this connection, each papillary muscle receives the impulse at approximately the same time, so they begin to contract
simultaneously just prior to the remainder of the myocardial contractile cells of the ventricles. This is believed to allow

Contractile cells demonstrate a much more stable resting phase than conductive cells at approximately −80 mV for cells
in the atria and −90 mV for cells in the ventricles. Despite this initial difference, the other components of their action

membranepotentialtoapproximately+30mV,atwhichpointthesodiumchannelsclose.Therapiddepolarizationperiod
typically lasts 3–5 ms. Depolarization is followed by the plateau phase, in which membrane potential declines relatively
slowly. This is due in large part to the opening of the slow Ca2+ channels, allowing Ca2+ to enter the cell while few K+
channels are open, allowing K+ to exit the cell. The relatively long plateau phase lasts approximately 175 ms. Once the
membrane potential reaches approximately zero, the Ca2+channels close and K+channels open, allowing K+to exit the
cell. The repolarization lasts approximately 75ms. At this point, membrane potential dropsuntil it reaches resting levels
once more and the cycle repeats. The entire event lasts between 250 and 300 ms (Figure 19.21).
Theabsoluterefractoryperiodforcardiaccontractilemusclelastsapproximately200ms,andtherelativerefractoryperiod
lasts approximately 50 ms, for a total of 250 ms. This extended period is critical, since the heart muscle must contract
to pump blood effectively and the contraction must follow the electrical events. Without extended refractory periods,
premature contractions would occur in the heart and would not be compatible with life.

calciumions.Theextendedrefractoryperiodallowsthecelltofullycontractbeforeanotherelectricaleventcanoccur.
(b) The action potential for heart muscle is compared to that of skeletal muscle.
Calcium Ions
Calcium ions play two critical roles in the physiology of cardiac muscle. Their influx through slow calcium channels
accounts for the prolonged plateau phase and absolute refractory period that enable cardiac muscle to function properly.
Calcium ions also combine with the regulatory protein troponin in the troponin-tropomyosin complex; this complex
removes the inhibition that prevents the heads of the myosin molecules from forming cross bridges with the active sites
on actin that provide the power stroke of contraction. This mechanism is virtually identical to that of skeletal muscle.

The remaining Ca2+for contraction is released from storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Comparative Rates of Conduction System Firing
The pattern of prepotential or spontaneous depolarization, followed by rapid depolarization and repolarization just

Occasional occurances are generally transitory and nonlife threatening, but if the condition becomes chronic, it
may lead to either an arrhythmia, a deviation from the normal pattern of impulse conduction and contraction, or to
fibrillation, an uncoordinated beating of the heart.
While interpretation of an ECG is possible and extremely valuable after some training, a full understanding of the
complexities and intricacies generally requires several years of experience. In general, the size of the electrical

often seen in patients with an acute MI, and may appear depressed below the baseline when hypoxia is occurring.
As useful as analyzing these electrical recordings may be, there are limitations. For example, not all areas suffering
a MI may be obvious on the ECG. Additionally, it will not reveal the effectiveness of the pumping, which requires
further testing, such as an ultrasound test called an echocardiogram or nuclear medicine imaging. It is also possible

blood, the patient’s life may not be in immediate danger. Ventricular fibrillation (see Figure 19.25d) is a medical
emergency that requires life support, because the ventricles are not effectively pumping blood. In a hospital setting,
it is often described as “code blue.” If untreated for as little as a few minutes, ventricular fibrillation may lead to
brain death. The most common treatment is defibrillation, which uses special paddles to apply a charge to the heart
from an external electrical source in an attempt to establish a normal sinus rhythm (Figure 19.26). A defibrillator

A heart block refers to an interruption in the normal conduction pathway. The nomenclature for these is very
straightforward.SAnodalblocksoccurwithintheSAnode.AVnodalblocksoccurwithintheAVnode.Infra-Hisianblocks
involve the bundle of His. Bundle branch blocks occur within either the left or right atrioventricular bundle branches.
Hemiblocks are partial and occur within one or more fascicles of the atrioventricular bundle branch. Clinically, the most
common types are the AV nodal and infra-Hisian blocks.
AVblocksareoftendescribedbydegrees.Afirst-degreeorpartialblockindicatesadelayinconductionbetweentheSA

Whenarrhythmiasbecomeachronicproblem,theheartmaintainsajunctionalrhythm,whichoriginatesintheAVnode.In
order to speed up the heart rate and restore full sinus rhythm, a cardiologist can implant an artificial pacemaker, which
delivers electrical impulses tothe heart muscle toensure that the heart continues tocontract andpumpbloodeffectively.
These artificial pacemakers are programmable by the cardiologists and can either provide stimulation temporarily upon
demand or on a continuous basis. Some devices also contain built-in defibrillators.
Cardiac Muscle Metabolism
Normally, cardiac muscle metabolism is entirely aerobic. Oxygen from the lungs is brought to the heart, and every
other organ, attached to the hemoglobin molecules within the erythrocytes. Heart cells also store appreciable amounts of
818 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART
oxygeninmyoglobin.Normally,thesetwomechanisms,circulatingoxygenandoxygenattachedtomyoglobin,cansupply
sufficient oxygen to the heart, even during peak performance.
Fatty acids and glucose from the circulation are broken down within the mitochondria to release energy in the form of
ATP.Bothfattyaciddropletsandglycogenarestoredwithinthesarcoplasmandprovideadditionalnutrientsupply.(Seek

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the relationship between blood pressure and blood flow
• Summarize the events of the cardiac cycle
• Compare atrial and ventricular systole and diastole
• Relate heart sounds detected by auscultation to action of heart’s valves
The period of time that begins with contraction of the atria and ends with ventricular relaxation is known as the cardiac
cycle (Figure 19.27). The period of contraction that the heart undergoes while it pumps blood into circulation is called

Pressures and Flow
Fluids,whethergasesorliquids,arematerialsthatflowaccordingtopressuregradients—thatis,theymovefromregions

bloodwillflowintotheatriafromtheveins,whicharehigherinpressure.Asbloodflowsintotheatria,thepressurewill
rise, so the blood will initially move passively from the atria into the ventricles. When the action potential triggers the
musclesintheatriatocontract(atrialsystole),thepressurewithintheatriarisesfurther,pumpingbloodintotheventricles.
Duringventricularsystole,pressurerisesintheventricles,pumpingbloodintothepulmonarytrunkfromtherightventricle
and into the aorta from the left ventricle. Again, as you consider this flow and relate it to the conduction pathway, the
elegance of the system should become apparent.
Phases of the Cardiac Cycle
At the beginning of the cardiac cycle, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed (diastole). Blood is flowing into the right
atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus. Blood flows into the left atrium from the four
pulmonaryveins.Thetwoatrioventricularvalves,thetricuspidandmitralvalves,arebothopen,sobloodflowsunimpeded
fromtheatriaandintotheventricles.Approximately70–80percentofventricularfillingoccursbythismethod.Thetwo
semilunarvalves,thepulmonaryandaorticvalves,areclosed,preventingbackflowofbloodintotherightandleftventricles
from the pulmonary trunk on the right and the aorta on the left.
Atrial Systole and Diastole
Contractionoftheatriafollowsdepolarization,representedbythePwaveoftheECG.Astheatrialmusclescontractfrom
the superior portion of the atria toward the atrioventricular septum, pressure rises within the atria and blood is pumped
intotheventriclesthroughtheopenatrioventricular(tricuspid,andmitralorbicuspid)valves.Atthestartofatrialsystole,
theventriclesarenormallyfilledwithapproximately70–80percentoftheircapacityduetoinflowduringdiastole.Atrial
contraction,alsoreferredtoasthe“atrialkick,”contributestheremaining20–30percentoffilling(seeFigure19.27).Atrial
systole lasts approximately 100 ms and ends prior to ventricular systole, as the atrial muscle returns to diastole.
Ventricular Systole
Ventricularsystole(seeFigure19.27)followsthedepolarizationoftheventriclesandisrepresentedbytheQRScomplex

volumeofbloodwithinthechamberremainsconstant.Consequently,thisinitialphaseofventricularsystoleisknownas
isovolumic contraction, also called isovolumetric contraction (seeFigure 19.27).
In the second phase of ventricular systole, the ventricular ejection phase, the contraction of the ventricular muscle has
raisedthepressurewithintheventricletothepointthatitisgreaterthanthepressuresinthepulmonarytrunkandtheaorta.
Bloodispumpedfromtheheart,pushingopenthepulmonaryandaorticsemilunarvalves.Pressuregeneratedbytheleft
ventricle will be appreciably greater than the pressure generated by the right ventricle, since the existing pressure in the
aortawillbesomuchhigher.Nevertheless,bothventriclespumpthesameamountofblood.Thisquantityisreferredtoas
stroke volume. Stroke volume will normally be in the range of 70–80 mL. Since ventricular systole began with an EDV
ofapproximately 130mL ofblood, this means that there is still 50–60mL ofblood remaining in the ventricle following
contraction. This volume of blood is known as theend systolic volume (ESV).
Ventricular Diastole
Ventricularrelaxation,ordiastole,followsrepolarizationoftheventriclesandisrepresentedbytheTwaveoftheECG.It
too is divided into two distinct phases and lasts approximately 430 ms.
Duringtheearlyphaseofventriculardiastole,astheventricularmusclerelaxes,pressureontheremainingbloodwithinthe

bloodflowsbacktowardtheheart,producingthedicroticnotch(smalldip)seeninbloodpressuretracings.Thesemilunar

changeinthevolumeofbloodintheventricle,sotheearlyphaseofventriculardiastoleiscalledtheisovolumicventricular
relaxation phase, also called isovolumetric ventricular relaxation phase (seeFigure 19.27).
In the second phase of ventricular diastole, called late ventricular diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure on
the blood within the ventricles drops even further. Eventually, it drops below the pressure in the atria. When this occurs,
blood flows from the atria into the ventricles, pushing open the tricuspid and mitral valves. As pressure dropswithin the
ventricles,bloodflowsfromthemajorveinsintotherelaxedatriaandfromthereintotheventricles.Bothchambersarein

value,multiplystrokevolume(SV),theamountofbloodpumpedbyeachventricle,byheartrate(HR),incontractions

CO = HR × SV
SV is normally measured using an echocardiogram to record EDV and ESV, and calculating the difference: SV = EDV
– ESV. SV can also be measured using a specialized catheter, but this is an invasive procedure and far more dangerous
to the patient. A mean SV for a resting 70-kg (150-lb) individual would be approximately 70 mL. There are several
importantvariables,includingsizeoftheheart,physicalandmentalconditionoftheindividual,sex,contractility,duration

refer to CO from each ventricle separately, not the total for the heart. Factors influencing CO are summarized in Figure

824 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART
Heart: Abnormal Heart Rates
For an adult, normal resting HR will be in the range of 60–100 bpm. Bradycardia is the condition in which resting
ratedropsbelow60bpm,andtachycardiaistheconditioninwhichtherestingrateisabove100bpm.Trainedathletes
typically have very low HRs. If the patient is not exhibiting other symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue, dizziness,
fainting, chest discomfort, palpitations, or respiratory distress, bradycardia is not considered clinically significant.
However,ifanyofthesesymptomsarepresent,theymayindicatethattheheartisnotprovidingsufficientoxygenated
bloodtothetissues.ThetermrelativebradycardiamaybeusedwithapatientwhohasaHRinthenormalrangebutis
still suffering from these symptoms. Most patients remain asymptomatic as long as the HR remains above 50 bpm.
Bradycardia may be caused by either inherent factors or causes external to the heart. While the condition may be
inherited, typically it is acquired in older individuals. Inherent causes include abnormalities in either the SA or AV
node. If the condition is serious, a pacemaker may be required. Other causes include ischemia to the heart muscle
or diseases of the heart vessels or valves. External causes include metabolic disorders, pathologies of the endocrine
systemofteninvolvingthethyroid,electrolyteimbalances,neurologicaldisordersincludinginappropriateautonomic
responses,autoimmunepathologies,over-prescriptionofbetablockerdrugsthatreduceHR,recreationaldruguse,or
evenprolongedbedrest.Treatmentreliesuponestablishingtheunderlyingcauseofthedisorderandmaynecessitate
supplemental oxygen.
Tachycardia is not normal in a resting patient but may be detected in pregnant women or individuals experiencing
extreme stress. In the latter case, it would likely be triggered by stimulation from the limbic system or disorders of
theautonomicnervoussystem.Insomecases,tachycardiamayinvolveonlytheatria.Someindividualsmayremain
asymptomatic,butwhenpresent,symptomsmayincludedizziness,shortnessofbreath,lightheadedness,rapidpulse,
heart palpations, chest pain, or fainting (syncope). While tachycardia is defined as a HR above 100 bpm, there is
considerable variation among people. Further, the normal resting HRs of children are often above 100 bpm, but
this is not considered to be tachycardia Many causes of tachycardia may be benign, but the condition may also be
correlated with fever,anemia, hypoxia, hyperthyroidism, hypersecretion ofcatecholamines, some cardiomyopathies,
some disorders of the valves, and acute exposure to radiation. Elevated rates in an exercising or resting patient are
normalandexpected.Restingrateshouldalwaysbetakenafterrecoveryfromexercise.Treatmentdependsuponthe
underlying cause but may include medications, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ablation, or surgery.
Correlation Between Heart Rates and Cardiac Output
Initially,physiologicalconditionsthatcauseHRtoincreasealsotriggeranincreaseinSV.Duringexercise,therateofblood
returning to the heart increases. However as the HR rises, there is less time spent in diastole and consequently less time

Cardiovascular Centers
Nervous control over HR is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centers of the medulla oblongata (Figure

Similarly,baroreceptorsarestretchreceptorslocatedintheaorticsinus,carotidbodies,thevenaecavae,andotherlocations,
including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent blood
pressure, level ofphysical activity,and the relative distribution ofblood. The cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing
to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex. With increased pressure and stretch, the
rateofbaroreceptorfiringincreases,andthecardiaccentersdecreasesympatheticstimulationandincreaseparasympathetic

Epinephrine and Norepinephrine
Thecatecholamines, epinephrine andNE,secreted bytheadrenal medulla formonecomponent oftheextended fight-or-
flight mechanism. The other component is sympathetic stimulation. Epinephrine and NE have similar effects: binding to
thebeta-1receptors, andopeningsodiumandcalcium ionchemical- orligand-gated channels. Therateofdepolarization
is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period
of repolarization is shortened. However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may
actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the adrenal medulla.

Nicotine, too, is a stimulant and produces addiction. While legal and nonregulated, concerns about nicotine’s safety and
documented links to respiratory and cardiac disease have resulted in warning labels on cigarette packages.
Factors Decreasing Heart Rate
HR can be slowed when a person experiences altered sodium and potassium levels, hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis, and
hypothermia(seeTable19.1).TherelationshipbetweenelectrolytesandHRiscomplex,butmaintainingelectrolytebalance
iscritical tothenormalwaveofdepolarization. Ofthetwoions,potassium hasthegreaterclinical significance. Initially,
both hyponatremia (low sodium levels) and hypernatremia (high sodium levels) may lead to tachycardia. Severely high
hypernatremiamayleadtofibrillation,whichmaycauseCOtocease.Severehyponatremialeadstobothbradycardiaand
otherarrhythmias.Hypokalemia(lowpotassiumlevels)alsoleadstoarrhythmias,whereashyperkalemia(highpotassium
levels) causes the heart to become weak and flaccid, and ultimately to fail.
Heart muscle relies exclusively on aerobic metabolism for energy. Hypoxia (an insufficient supply of oxygen) leads to
decreasing HRs, since metabolic reactions fueling heart contraction are restricted.
Acidosis is a condition in which excess hydrogen ions are present, and the patient’s blood expresses a low pH value.
Alkalosisisaconditioninwhichtherearetoofewhydrogenions,andthepatient’sbloodhasanelevatedpH.Normalblood
pHfallsintherangeof7.35–7.45,soanumberlowerthanthisrangerepresentsacidosisandahighernumberrepresents
alkalosis. Recall that enzymes are the regulators or catalysts of virtually all biochemical reactions; they are sensitive to
pH and will change shape slightly with values outside their normal range. These variations in pH and accompanying
slight physical changes to the active site on the enzyme decrease the rate of formation of the enzyme-substrate complex,
subsequentlydecreasingtherateofmanyenzymaticreactions,whichcanhavecomplexeffectsonHR.Severechangesin
pH will lead to denaturation of the enzyme.
Thelastvariableisbodytemperature.Elevatedbodytemperatureiscalledhyperthermia,andsuppressedbodytemperature
is called hypothermia. Slight hyperthermia results in increasing HR and strength of contraction. Hypothermia slows the
rateandstrengthofheartcontractions.Thisdistinctslowingoftheheartisonecomponentofthelargerdivingreflexthat

Excessive hyperthermia and hypothermia will both result in death, as enzymes drive the body systems to cease normal
function, beginning with the central nervous system.
Stroke Volume
Many of the same factors that regulate HR also impact cardiac function by altering SV. While a number of variables are
involved,SVisultimatelydependentuponthedifferencebetweenEDVandESV.Thethreeprimaryfactorstoconsiderare
preload,orthestretchontheventriclespriortocontraction;thecontractility,ortheforceorstrengthofthecontractionitself;
andafterload,theforcetheventriclesmustgeneratetopumpbloodagainsttheresistanceinthevessels.Thesefactorsare
summarized inTable 19.1andTable 19.2.
Preload
PreloadisanotherwayofexpressingEDV.Therefore,thegreatertheEDVis,thegreaterthepreloadis.Oneoftheprimary
factorstoconsiderisfillingtime,orthedurationofventriculardiastoleduringwhichfillingoccurs.Themorerapidlythe
heart contracts, the shorter the filling time becomes, and the lower the EDV and preload are. This effect can be partially
overcomebyincreasingthesecondvariable,contractility,andraisingSV,butovertime,theheartisunabletocompensate
for decreased filling time, and preload also decreases.
With increasing ventricular filling, both EDV or preload increase, and the cardiac muscle itself is stretched to a greater
degree.Atrest,thereislittlestretchoftheventricularmuscle,andthesarcomeresremainshort.Withincreasedventricular
filling, theventricular muscle isincreasingly stretched andthesarcomere lengthincreases. Asthesarcomeres reachtheir
optimal lengths, they will contract more powerfully, because more of the myosin heads can bind to the actin on the thin
filaments,formingcrossbridgesandincreasingthestrengthofcontractionandSV.Ifthisprocessweretocontinueandthe
sarcomeresstretchedbeyondtheiroptimallengths,theforceofcontractionwoulddecrease.However,duetothephysical
constraints of the location of the heart, this excessive stretch is not a concern.
Therelationshipbetweenventricularstretchandcontractionhasbeenstatedinthewell-knownFrank-Starlingmechanism
orsimplyStarling’sLawoftheHeart.Thisprinciplestatesthat,withinphysiologicallimits,theforceofheartcontraction
830 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART
is directly proportional to the initial length of the muscle fiber. This means that the greater the stretch of the ventricular
muscle(withinlimits),themorepowerfulthecontractionis,whichinturnincreasesSV.Therefore,byincreasingpreload,
you increase the second variable, contractility.
OttoFrank(1865–1944)wasaGermanphysiologist;amonghismanypublishedworksaredetailedstudiesofthisimportant
heartrelationship.ErnestStarling(1866–1927)wasanimportantEnglishphysiologistwhoalsostudiedtheheart.Although
they worked largely independently, their combined efforts and similar conclusions have been recognized in the name
“Frank-Starling mechanism.”
Anysympatheticstimulationtothevenoussystemwillincreasevenousreturntotheheart,whichcontributestoventricular
filling,andEDVandpreload.Whilemuchoftheventricularfillingoccurswhilebothatriaandventriclesareindiastole,
the contraction of the atria, the atrial kick, plays a crucial role by providing the last 20–30 percent of ventricular filling.
Contractility
It is virtually impossible to consider preload or ESV without including an early mention of the concept of contractility.
Indeed, the two parameters are intimately linked. Contractility refers to the force of the contraction of the heart muscle,
whichcontrolsSV,andistheprimaryparameterforimpactingESV.Themoreforcefulthecontractionis,thegreatertheSV
andsmallertheESVare.LessforcefulcontractionsresultinsmallerSVsandlargerESVs.Factorsthatincreasecontractility
aredescribedaspositiveinotropicfactors,andthosethatdecreasecontractilityaredescribedasnegativeinotropicfactors
(ino- = “fiber;” -tropic = “turning toward”).
Notsurprisingly,sympatheticstimulationisapositiveinotrope,whereasparasympatheticstimulationisanegativeinotrope.
Sympathetic stimulation triggers the release of NE at the neuromuscular junction from the cardiac nerves and also
stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete epinephrine and NE. In addition to their stimulatory effects on HR, they also
bind to both alpha and beta receptors on the cardiac muscle cell membrane to increase metabolic rate and the force of
contraction. This combination of actions has the net effect of increasing SV and leaving a smaller residual ESV in the
ventricles.Incomparison,parasympatheticstimulationreleasesAChattheneuromuscularjunctionfromthevagusnerve.
The membrane hyperpolarizes and inhibits contraction to decrease the strength of contraction and SV, and to raise ESV.
Sinceparasympatheticfibersaremorewidespreadintheatriathanintheventricles,theprimarysiteofactionisintheupper
chambers.ParasympatheticstimulationintheatriadecreasestheatrialkickandreducesEDV,whichdecreasesventricular
stretchandpreload,therebyfurtherlimitingtheforceofventricularcontraction.Strongerparasympatheticstimulationalso
directly decreases the force of contraction of the ventricles.
Severalsyntheticdrugs,includingdopamineandisoproterenol,havebeendevelopedthatmimictheeffectsofepinephrine
andNEbystimulatingtheinfluxofcalciumionsfromtheextracellularfluid.Higherconcentrationsofintracellularcalcium
ionsincreasethestrengthofcontraction.Excesscalcium(hypercalcemia)alsoactsasapositiveinotropicagent.Thedrug
digitalis lowers HR and increases the strength of the contraction, acting as a positive inotropic agent by blocking the
sequesteringofcalciumionsintothesarcoplasmicreticulum.Thisleadstohigherintracellularcalciumlevelsandgreater
strength of contraction. In addition to the catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, other hormones also demonstrate
positive inotropic effects. These include thyroid hormones and glucagon from the pancreas.
Negative inotropic agents include hypoxia, acidosis, hyperkalemia, and a variety of synthetic drugs. These include
numerousbetablockersandcalciumchannelblockers.Earlybetablockerdrugsincludepropranololandpronethalol,and
arecreditedwithrevolutionizing treatment ofcardiacpatientsexperiencinganginapectoris.Thereisalsoalargeclassof
dihydropyridine,phenylalkylamine,andbenzothiazepinecalciumchannelblockersthatmaybeadministereddecreasingthe
strength of contraction and SV.
Afterload

vascularsystem.Anyconditionthatincreasesresistancerequiresagreaterafterloadtoforceopenthesemilunarvalvesand

The remainder of the heart development pattern includes development of septa and valves, and remodeling of the actual
chambers. Partitioning of the atria and ventricles by the interatrial septum, interventricular septum, and atrioventricular
septum is complete by the end of the fifth week, although the fetal blood shunts remain until birth or shortly after. The
atrioventricular valves form between weeks five and eight, and the semilunar valves form between weeks five and nine.

19.3Cardiac Cycle
Thecardiaccyclecomprisesacompleterelaxationandcontractionofboththeatriaandventricles,andlastsapproximately
0.8 seconds. Beginning with all chambers in diastole, blood flows passively from the veins into the atria and past the
atrioventricularvalvesintotheventricles.Theatriabegintocontract(atrialsystole),followingdepolarizationoftheatria,
and pump blood into the ventricles. The ventricles begin to contract (ventricular systole), raising pressure within the

19.4Cardiac Physiology
ManyfactorsaffectHRandSV,andtogether,theycontributetocardiacfunction.HRislargelydeterminedandregulated
by autonomic stimulation and hormones. There are several feedback loops that contribute to maintaining homeostasis
dependent upon activity levels, such as the atrial reflex, which is determined by venous return.
840 CHAPTER 19 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: THE HEART
SV is regulated by autonomic innervation and hormones, but also by filling time and venous return. Venous return
is determined by activity of the skeletal muscles, blood volume, and changes in peripheral circulation. Venous return

Introduction
Chapter Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Compare and contrast the anatomical structure of arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins
844 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION
• Accurately describe the forces that account for capillary exchange
• List the major factors affecting blood flow, blood pressure, and resistance
• Describe how blood flow, blood pressure, and resistance interrelate
• Discuss how the neural and endocrine mechanisms maintain homeostasis within the blood vessels
• Describe the interaction of the cardiovascular system with other body systems
• Label the major blood vessels of the pulmonary and systemic circulations
• Identify and describe the hepatic portal system
• Describe the development of blood vessels and fetal circulation
• Compare fetal circulation to that of an individual after birth
Inthischapter,youwilllearnaboutthevascularpartofthecardiovascularsystem,thatis,thevesselsthattransportblood
throughout the body and provide the physical site where gases, nutrients, and other substances are exchanged with body
cells. When vessel functioning is reduced, blood-borne substances do not circulate effectively throughout the body. As a
result, tissue injury occurs, metabolism is impaired, and the functions of every bodily system are threatened.
20.1 | Structure and Function of Blood Vessels
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Compare and contrast the three tunics that make up the walls of most blood vessels
• Distinguishbetweenelasticarteries,musculararteries,andarteriolesonthebasisofstructure,location,andfunction
• Describe the basic structure of a capillary bed, from the supplying metarteriole to the venule into which it drains
• Explain the structure and function of venous valves in the large veins of the extremities
Blood is carried through the body via blood vessels. An artery is a blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart,
whereitbranches intoever-smaller vessels. Eventually,thesmallest arteries, vessels called arterioles, furtherbranchinto
tinycapillaries,wherenutrientsandwastesareexchanged,andthencombinewithothervesselsthatexitcapillariestoform
venules, small blood vessels that carry blood to a vein, a larger blood vessel that returns blood to the heart.
Arteries and veins transport blood in two distinct circuits: the systemic circuit and the pulmonary circuit (Figure 20.2).
Systemic arteries provide blood rich in oxygen to the body’s tissues. The blood returned to the heart through systemic
veinshaslessoxygen,sincemuchoftheoxygencarriedbythearterieshasbeendeliveredtothecells.Incontrast,inthe
pulmonarycircuit,arteriescarrybloodlowinoxygenexclusivelytothelungsforgasexchange.Pulmonaryveinsthenreturn

indiameter,allowingmorebloodtoflowwithlessvesselresistance.Inaddition,manyveinsofthebody,particularlythose

becomes sluggish in the extremities, as a result of the lower pressure and the effects of gravity.
Thewallsofarteries andveinsarelargelycomposedoflivingcells andtheirproducts(including collagenous andelastic
fibers);thecellsrequirenourishmentandproducewaste.Sincebloodpassesthroughthelargervesselsrelativelyquickly,
there is limited opportunity for blood in the lumen of the vessel to provide nourishment to or remove waste from the
vessel’scells.Further,thewallsofthelargervesselsaretoothickfornutrientstodiffusethroughtoallofthecells.Larger
arteries and veins contain small blood vessels within their walls known as the vasa vasorum—literally “vessels of the
vessel”—toprovidethemwiththiscriticalexchange.Sincethepressurewithinarteriesisrelativelyhigh,thevasavasorum
mustfunctionintheouterlayersofthevessel(seeFigure20.3)orthepressureexertedbythebloodpassingthroughthe
vesselwouldcollapseit,preventinganyexchangefromoccurring.Thelowerpressurewithinveinsallowsthevasavasorum
to be located closer to the lumen. The restriction of the vasa vasorum to the outer layers of arteries is thought to be one
reasonthatarterialdiseasesaremorecommonthanvenousdiseases,sinceitslocationmakesitmoredifficulttonourishthe

that it is physiologically critical to such activities as helping to regulate capillary exchange and altering blood flow. The
endotheliumreleaseslocalchemicalscalledendothelinsthatcanconstrictthesmoothmusclewithinthewallsofthevessel

Arteries
An artery is a blood vessel that conducts blood away from the heart. All arteries have relatively thick walls that can
withstand the high pressure of blood ejected from the heart. However, those close to the heart have the thickest walls,
containingahighpercentageofelasticfibersinallthreeoftheirtunics.Thistypeofarteryisknownasanelasticartery
(Figure 20.4). Vessels larger than 10 mm in diameter are typically elastic. Their abundant elastic fibers allow them to
expand,asbloodpumpedfromtheventriclespassesthroughthem,andthentorecoilafterthesurgehaspassed.Ifartery
wallswererigidandunabletoexpandandrecoil,theirresistancetobloodflowwouldgreatlyincreaseandbloodpressure
would rise to even higher levels, which would in turn require the heart to pump harder to increase the volume of blood
expelledbyeachpump(thestrokevolume)andmaintainadequatepressureandflow.Arterywallswouldhavetobecome
even thicker in response to this increased pressure. The elastic recoil of the vascular wall helps to maintain the pressure
gradientthatdrivesthebloodthroughthearterialsystem.Anelasticarteryisalsoknownasaconductingartery,becausethe
large diameter of the lumen enables it to accept a large volume of blood from the heart and conduct it to smaller branches.

of gases and other substances occurs in the capillaries between the blood and the surrounding cells and their tissue fluid
(interstitial fluid). The diameter of a capillary lumen ranges from 5–10 micrometers; the smallest are just barely wide
enough for an erythrocyte to squeeze through. Flow through capillaries is often described asmicrocirculation.

and many endocrine structures, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal, and thyroid glands.
Sinusoid Capillaries
A sinusoid capillary (or sinusoid) is the least common type of capillary. Sinusoid capillaries are flattened, and they
haveextensiveintercellulargapsandincompletebasementmembranes,inadditiontointercellularcleftsandfenestrations.
This gives them an appearance not unlike Swiss cheese. These very large openings allow for the passage of the largest
molecules, including plasma proteins and even cells. Blood flow through sinusoids is very slow, allowing more time for
exchangeofgases,nutrients,andwastes.Sinusoidsarefoundintheliverandspleen,bonemarrow,lymphnodes(wherethey

to supply blood to acapillary bedthat may consist of 10–100 capillaries.
The precapillary sphincters, circular smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin with the metarteriole,
tightly regulate the flow of blood from a metarteriole to the capillaries it supplies. Their function is critical: If all of the
capillary beds in the body were to open simultaneously, they would collectively hold every drop of blood in the body
andtherewouldbenoneinthearteries,arterioles,venules,veins,ortheheartitself.Normally,theprecapillarysphincters
are closed. When the surrounding tissues need oxygen and have excess waste products, the precapillary sphincters open,
allowing blood to flow through and exchange to occur before closing once more (Figure 20.6). If all of the precapillary
sphincters in a capillary bed are closed, blood will flow from the metarteriole directly into a thoroughfare channel and
thenintothevenouscirculation,bypassingthecapillarybedentirely.Thiscreateswhatisknownasavascularshunt.In
addition, anarteriovenous anastomosismay bypass the capillary bed and lead directly to the venous system.
Althoughyoumightexpectbloodflowthroughacapillarybedtobesmooth,inreality,itmoveswithanirregular,pulsating
flow. This pattern is called vasomotion and is regulated by chemical signals that are triggered in response to changes in
internal conditions, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion, and lactic acid levels. For example, during strenuous

During sleep or rest periods, vessels in both areas are largely closed; they open only occasionally to allow oxygen and
nutrient supplies to travel to the tissues to maintain basic life processes.

Figure 20.8Varicose VeinsVaricose veins are commonly found in the lower limbs. (credit: Thomas Kriese)
Edema may be accompanied by varicose veins, especially in the superficial veins of the legs (Figure 20.8). This
disorderariseswhendefectivevalvesallowbloodtoaccumulatewithintheveins,causingthemtodistend,twist,and
become visible on the surface of the integument. Varicose veins may occur in both sexes, but are more common in
women and are often related to pregnancy. More than simple cosmetic blemishes, varicose veins are often painful
and sometimes itchy or throbbing. Without treatment, they tend to grow worse over time. The use of support hose,
as well as elevating the feet and legs whenever possible, may be helpful in alleviating this condition. Laser surgery
andinterventionalradiologicprocedurescanreducethesizeandseverityofvaricoseveins.Severecasesmayrequire
conventional surgery to remove the damaged vessels. As there are typically redundant circulation patterns, that is,
anastomoses, for the smaller and more superficial veins, removal does not typically impair the circulation. There is
evidence that patients with varicose veins suffer a greater risk of developing a thrombus or clot.

Generally, a pulse pressure should be at least 25 percent of the systolic pressure. A pulse pressure below this level is
described as low or narrow. This may occur, for example, in patients with a low stroke volume, which may be seen in
congestiveheartfailure,stenosisoftheaorticvalve,orsignificantbloodlossfollowingtrauma.Incontrast,ahighorwide

pulse pressures can degrade the heart, brain, and kidneys, and warrant medical treatment.
Mean Arterial Pressure
Meanarterialpressure(MAP)representsthe“average”pressureofbloodinthearteries,thatis,theaverageforcedriving
blood into vessels that serve the tissues. Mean is a statistical concept and is calculated by taking the sum of the values
divided by the number of values. Although complicated to measure directly and complicated to calculate, MAP can be
approximated by adding the diastolic pressure to one-third of the pulse pressure or systolic pressure minus the diastolic
pressure:
(systolic-diastolic BP)
MAP = diastolic BP +
3
In Figure 20.10, this value is approximately 80 + (120 − 80) / 3, or 93.33. Normally, the MAP falls within the range of
70–110mmHg.Ifthevaluefallsbelow60mmHgforanextendedtime,bloodpressurewillnotbehighenoughtoensure

Measurement of Blood Pressure
Blood pressure is one of the critical parameters measured on virtually every patient in every healthcare setting. The
technique used today was developed more than 100 years ago by a pioneering Russian physician, Dr. Nikolai Korotkoff.
Turbulentbloodflowthroughthevesselscanbeheardasasofttickingwhilemeasuringbloodpressure;thesesoundsare
known as Korotkoff sounds. The technique of measuring blood pressure requires the use of a sphygmomanometer (a
blood pressure cuff attached to a measuring device) and a stethoscope. The technique is as follows:
• The clinician wraps an inflatable cuff tightly around the patient’s arm at about the level of the heart.
• The clinician squeezes a rubber pump to inject air into the cuff, raising pressure around the artery and temporarily
cutting off blood flow into the patient’s arm.
• The clinician places the stethoscope on the patient’s antecubital region and, while gradually allowing air within the
cuff to escape, listens for the Korotkoff sounds.

AlthoughtherearefiverecognizedKorotkoffsounds,onlytwoarenormallyrecorded.Initially,nosoundsareheardsince
there is no blood flow through the vessels, but as air pressure drops, the cuff relaxes, and blood flow returns to the arm.
As shown in Figure 20.12, the first sound heard through the stethoscope—the first Korotkoff sound—indicates systolic
pressure. As more air is released from the cuff, blood is able to flow freely through the brachial artery and all sounds
disappear. The point at which the last sound is heard is recorded as the patient’s diastolic pressure.
Figure 20.12 Blood Pressure Measurement When pressure in a sphygmomanometer cuff is released, a clinician
can hear the Korotkoff sounds. In this graph, a blood pressure tracing is aligned to a measurement of systolic and
diastolic pressures.
The majority of hospitals and clinics have automated equipment for measuring blood pressure that work on the same
principles.Anevenmorerecentinnovationisasmallinstrumentthatwrapsaroundapatient’swrist.Thepatientthenholds

Variables Affecting Blood Flow and Blood Pressure
Five variables influence blood flow and blood pressure:
• Cardiac output
• Compliance
• Volume of the blood
• Viscosity of the blood
• Blood vessel length and diameter
Recallthatbloodmovesfromhigherpressuretolowerpressure.Itispumpedfromtheheartintothearteriesathighpressure.
If you increase pressure in the arteries (afterload), and cardiac function does not compensate, blood flow will actually
decrease.Inthevenoussystem,theoppositerelationshipistrue.Increasedpressureintheveinsdoesnotdecreaseflowas

intotheheart,thepressureintheatriaduringatrialdiastolemustbeevenlower.Itnormallyapproacheszero,exceptwhen
the atria contract (seeFigure 20.10).
Cardiac Output
Cardiac output is the measurement of blood flow from the heart through the ventricles, and is usually measured in liters
perminute.Anyfactorthatcausescardiacoutputtoincrease,byelevatingheartrateorstrokevolumeorboth,willelevate
bloodpressureandpromotebloodflow.Thesefactorsincludesympatheticstimulation,thecatecholaminesepinephrineand
norepinephrine,thyroidhormones,andincreasedcalciumionlevels.Conversely,anyfactorthatdecreasescardiacoutput,
by decreasing heart rate or stroke volume or both, will decrease arterial pressure and blood flow. These factors include
parasympathetic stimulation, elevated or decreased potassium ion levels, decreased calcium levels, anoxia, and acidosis.
Compliance
Compliance is the ability of any compartment to expand to accommodate increased content. A metal pipe, for example,
is not compliant, whereas a balloon is. The greater the compliance of an artery, the more effectively it is able to expand
to accommodate surges in blood flow without increased resistance or blood pressure. Veins are more compliant than

A Mathematical Approach to Factors Affecting Blood Flow
Jean Louis Marie Poiseuille was a French physician and physiologist who devised a mathematical equation describing
bloodflowanditsrelationshiptoknownparameters.Thesameequationalsoappliestoengineeringstudiesoftheflowof
fluids.Althoughunderstandingthemathbehindtherelationshipsamongthefactorsaffectingbloodflowisnotnecessaryto
understandbloodflow,itcanhelpsolidifyanunderstandingoftheirrelationships.Pleasenotethateveniftheequationlooks
intimidating, breaking it down into its components and following the relationships will make these relationships clearer,
even if you are weak in math. Focus on the three critical variables: radius (r), vessel length (λ), and viscosity (η).
Poiseuille’s equation:
π ΔP r4
Blood fl w =
8ηλ
• πistheGreekletterpi,usedtorepresentthemathematicalconstantthatistheratioofacircle’scircumferencetoits
diameter. It may commonly be represented as 3.14, although the actual number extends to infinity.
• ΔP represents the difference in pressure.
• r4is the radius (one-half of the diameter) of the vessel to the fourth power.
• η is the Greek letter eta and represents the viscosity of the blood.
• λ is the Greek letter lambda and represents the length of a blood vessel.
Oneofseveralthingsthisequationallowsustodoiscalculatetheresistanceinthevascularsystem.Normallythisvalueis
extremely difficult to measure, but it can be calculated from this known relationship:
ΔP
Blood fl w =
Resistance
If we rearrange this slightly,
ΔP
Resistance =
Blood fl w
Then by substituting Pouseille’s equation for blood flow:
8ηλ
Resistance =

Byexaminingthisequation,youcanseethatthereareonlythreevariables:viscosity,vessellength,andradius,since8andπ

Wehavebrieflyconsideredhowcardiacoutputandbloodvolumeimpactbloodflowandpressure;thenextstepistosee
how the other variables (contraction, vessel length, and viscosity) articulate with Pouseille’s equation and what they can
teach us about the impact on blood flow.
Blood Volume
The relationship between blood volume, blood pressure, and blood flow is intuitively obvious. Water may merely trickle
alongacreekbedinadryseason,butrushquicklyandundergreatpressureafteraheavyrain.Similarly,asbloodvolume
decreases, pressure and flow decrease. As blood volume increases, pressure and flow increase.
Under normal circumstances, blood volume varies little. Low blood volume, called hypovolemia, may be caused by
bleeding,dehydration,vomiting,severeburns,orsomemedicationsusedtotreathypertension.Itisimportanttorecognize
that other regulatory mechanisms in the body are so effective at maintaining blood pressure that an individual may be
asymptomatic until 10–20 percent of the blood volume has been lost. Treatment typically includes intravenous fluid
replacement.
Hypervolemia, excessive fluid volume, may be caused by retention of water and sodium, as seen in patients with heart
failure, liver cirrhosis, some forms of kidney disease, hyperaldosteronism, and some glucocorticoid steroid treatments.
Restoring homeostasis in these patients depends upon reversing the condition that triggered the hypervolemia.
Blood Viscosity
Viscosity is the thickness of fluids that affects their ability to flow. Clean water, for example, is less viscous than mud.
The viscosity of blood is directly proportional to resistance and inversely proportional to flow; therefore, any condition

thatcausesviscositytoincreasewillalsoincreaseresistanceanddecreaseflow.Forexample,imaginesippingmilk,then
a milkshake, through the same size straw. You experience more resistance and therefore less flow from the milkshake.
Conversely,anyconditionthatcausesviscositytodecrease(suchaswhenthemilkshakemelts)willdecreaseresistanceand
increase flow.

affectingerythropoiesis,suchaspolycythemiaoranemia,canalterviscosity.Sincemostplasmaproteinsareproducedby
the liver, any condition affecting liver function can also change the viscosity slightly and therefore decrease blood flow.
Liver abnormalities include hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcohol damage, and drug toxicities. While leukocytes and platelets are
normally a small component of the formed elements, there are some rare conditions in which severe overproduction can
impact viscosity as well.

Thelengthofavesselisdirectlyproportionaltoitsresistance:thelongerthevessel,thegreatertheresistanceandthelower
theflow.Aswithbloodvolume,thismakesintuitivesense,sincetheincreasedsurfaceareaofthevesselwillimpedethe

from 2000 to 4000 miles of vessels, depending upon the nature of the gained tissue. One of the great benefits of weight
reduction is the reduced stress to the heart, which does not have to overcome the resistance of as many miles of vessels.
In contrast to length, the diameter of blood vessels changes throughout the body, according to the type of vessel, as we

surprising, given that capillaries have a smaller size. How can this phenomenon be explained?

Arteriosclerosisbeginswithinjurytotheendotheliumofanartery,whichmaybecausedbyirritationfromhighblood
glucose, infection, tobacco use, excessive blood lipids, and other factors. Artery walls that are constantly stressed
by blood flowing at high pressure are also more likely to be injured—which means that hypertension can promote
arteriosclerosis, as well as result from it.
Recall that tissue injury causes inflammation. As inflammation spreads into the artery wall, it weakens and scars it,

in the atria during diastole is very low, often approaching zero when the atria are relaxed (atrial diastole). Second, two
physiologic “pumps” increase pressure in the venous system. The use of the term “pump” implies a physical device that
speeds flow. These physiological pumps are less obvious.

Pressure Relationships in the Venous System
Althoughvesseldiameterincreasesfromthesmallervenulestothelargerveinsandeventuallytothevenaecavae(singular
=venacava),thetotalcross-sectionalareaactuallydecreases(seeFigure20.15aandb).Theindividualveinsarelargerin
diameter than the venules, but their total number is much lower, so their total cross-sectional area is also lower.
Also notice that, as blood moves from venules to veins, the average blood pressure drops (see Figure 20.15c), but the
blood velocity actually increases (see Figure 20.15). This pressure gradient drives blood back toward the heart. Again,
the presence of one-way valves and the skeletal muscle and respiratory pumps contribute to this increased flow. Since
approximately64percentofthetotalbloodvolumeresidesinsystemicveins,anyactionthatincreasestheflowofblood
through the veins will increase venous return to the heart. Maintaining vascular tone within the veins prevents the veins
from merely distending, dampening the flow of blood, and as you will see, vasoconstriction actually enhances the flow.
The Role of Venoconstriction in Resistance, Blood Pressure, and Flow
Aspreviouslydiscussed,vasoconstrictionofanarteryorarterioledecreasestheradius,increasingresistanceandpressure,
but decreasing flow. Venoconstriction, on the other hand, has a very different outcome. The walls of veins are thin but
irregular; thus, when the smooth muscle in those walls constricts, the lumen becomes more rounded. The more rounded
thelumen,thelesssurfaceareathebloodencounters,andthelessresistancethevesseloffers.Vasoconstriction increases
pressure within a vein as it does in an artery, but in veins, the increased pressure increases flow. Recall that the pressure
in the atria, into which the venous blood will flow,is very low,approaching zero forat least part ofthe relaxation phase
of the cardiac cycle. Thus, venoconstriction increases the return of blood to the heart. Another way of stating this is that
venoconstriction increases the preload or stretch of the cardiac muscle and increases contraction.
20.3 | Capillary Exchange

• Identify the primary mechanisms of capillary exchange
• Distinguishbetweencapillaryhydrostaticpressureandbloodcolloidosmoticpressure,explainingthecontribution
of each to net filtration pressure
• Compare filtration and reabsorption

from an area of higher pressure in a capillary bed to an area of lower pressure in the tissues via filtration. In contrast,
the movement of fluid from an area of higher pressure in the tissues into an area of lower pressure in the capillaries is
reabsorption. Two types of pressure interact to drive each of these movements: hydrostatic pressure and osmotic pressure.

Osmotic Pressure
The net pressure that drives reabsorption—the movement of fluid from the interstitial fluid back into the capillaries—is
called osmotic pressure (sometimes referred to as oncotic pressure). Whereas hydrostatic pressure forces fluid out of the
capillary,osmoticpressuredrawsfluidbackin.Osmoticpressureisdeterminedbyosmoticconcentrationgradients,thatis,

As we discuss osmotic pressure in blood and tissue fluid, it is important to recognize that the formed elements of blood
do not contribute to osmotic concentration gradients. Rather, it is the plasma proteins that play the key role. Solutes also

distribution, and perfusion involve autoregulatory, neural, and endocrine mechanisms.
Neural Regulation
Thenervoussystemplaysacriticalroleintheregulationofvascularhomeostasis.Theprimaryregulatorysitesincludethe
cardiovascular centers in the brain that control both cardiac and vascular functions. In addition, more generalized neural
responses from the limbic system and the autonomic nervous system are factors.
The Cardiovascular Centers in the Brain
Neurologicalregulationofbloodpressureandflowdependsonthecardiovascularcenterslocatedinthemedullaoblongata.
Thisclusterofneuronsrespondstochangesinbloodpressureaswellasbloodconcentrationsofoxygen,carbondioxide,
and hydrogen ions. The cardiovascular center contains three distinct paired components:
• The cardioaccelerator centers stimulate cardiac function by regulating heart rate and stroke volume via sympathetic
stimulation from the cardiac accelerator nerve.
870 CHAPTER 20 | THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: BLOOD VESSELS AND CIRCULATION
• The cardioinhibitor centers slow cardiac function by decreasing heart rate and stroke volume via parasympathetic
stimulation from the vagus nerve.
• The vasomotor centers control vessel tone or contraction of the smooth muscle in the tunica media. Changes in
diameter affect peripheral resistance, pressure, andflow,which affect cardiac output. The majority ofthese neurons
act via the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons.
Although each center functions independently, they are not anatomically distinct.
There is also a small population of neurons that control vasodilation in the vessels of the brain and skeletal muscles
by relaxing the smooth muscle fibers in the vessel tunics. Many of these are cholinergic neurons, that is, they release
acetylcholine,whichinturnstimulatesthevessels’endothelialcellstoreleasenitricoxide(NO),whichcausesvasodilation.
Others release norepinephrine that binds to β2receptors. A few neurons release NO directly as a neurotransmitter.
Recall that mild stimulation of the skeletal muscles maintains muscle tone. A similar phenomenon occurs with vascular
toneinvessels.Asnotedearlier,arteriolesarenormallypartiallyconstricted:Withmaximalstimulation,theirradiusmay
be reduced to one-half of the resting state. Full dilation of most arterioles requires that this sympathetic stimulation be
suppressed. When it is, an arteriole can expand by as much as 150 percent. Such a significant increase can dramatically
affect resistance, pressure, and flow.

oftheheart.Asaresult,cardiacoutputfalls.Sympatheticstimulationoftheperipheralarterioleswillalsodecrease,
resulting in vasodilation. Combined, these activities cause blood pressure to fall.

Since tissues consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide and acids as waste products, when the body is more active,
oxygenlevelsfallandcarbondioxidelevelsriseascellsundergocellularrespirationtomeettheenergyneedsofactivities.
This causes more hydrogen ions to be produced, causing the blood pH to drop. When the body is resting, oxygen levels

The chemoreceptors respond to increasing carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels (falling pH) by stimulating the
cardioacceleratorandvasomotorcenters,increasingcardiacoutputandconstrictingperipheralvessels.Thecardioinhibitor

Erythropoietin
Erythropoietin (EPO) is released by the kidneys when blood flow and/or oxygen levels decrease. EPO stimulates the
production of erythrocytes within the bone marrow. Erythrocytes are the major formed element of the blood and may
contribute 40 percent or more to blood volume, a significant factor of viscosity, resistance, pressure, and flow. In
addition,EPOisavasoconstrictor.OverproductionofEPOorexcessiveintakeofsyntheticEPO,oftentoenhanceathletic

Autoregulation of Perfusion
As the name would suggest, autoregulation mechanisms require neither specialized nervous stimulation nor endocrine
control.Rather,thesearelocal,self-regulatorymechanismsthatalloweachregionoftissuetoadjustitsbloodflow—and
thus its perfusion. These local mechanisms include chemical signals and myogenic controls.
Chemical Signals Involved in Autoregulation
Chemicalsignalsworkattheleveloftheprecapillarysphincterstotriggereitherconstrictionorrelaxation.Asyouknow,
opening a precapillary sphincter allows blood to flow into that particular capillary, whereas constricting a precapillary
sphincter temporarily shuts off blood flow to that region. The factors involved in regulating the precapillary sphincters
include the following:
• Opening of the sphincter is triggered in response to decreased oxygen concentrations; increased carbon dioxide
concentrations;increasinglevelsoflacticacidorotherbyproductsofcellularmetabolism;increasingconcentrations
of potassium ions or hydrogen ions (falling pH); inflammatory chemicals such as histamines; and increased body
temperature.TheseconditionsinturnstimulatethereleaseofNO,apowerfulvasodilator,fromendothelialcells(see
Figure 20.17).
• Contraction of the precapillary sphincter is triggered by the opposite levels of the regulators, which prompt the
releaseofendothelins,powerfulvasoconstrictingpeptidessecretedbyendothelialcells.Plateletsecretionsandcertain
prostaglandins may also trigger constriction.

Clinical Considerations in Vascular Homeostasis

Hypertension and Hypotension
Chronically elevated blood pressure is known clinically as hypertension. It is defined as chronic and persistent blood
pressure measurements of 140/90 mm Hg or above. Pressures between 120/80 and 140/90 mm Hg are defined as
prehypertension.About68millionAmericanscurrentlysufferfromhypertension.Unfortunately,hypertensionistypically

as a “silent killer.” What steps can you take to reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke?
Hemorrhage
Minor blood loss is managed by hemostasis and repair. Hemorrhage is a loss of blood that cannot be controlled by
hemostatic mechanisms. Initially, the body responds to hemorrhage by initiating mechanisms aimed at increasing blood
pressure and maintaining blood flow. Ultimately, however, blood volume will need to be restored, either through
physiological processes or through medical intervention.
In response to blood loss, stimuli from the baroreceptors trigger the cardiovascular centers to stimulate sympathetic
responsestoincreasecardiacoutputandvasoconstriction.Thistypicallypromptstheheartratetoincreasetoabout180–200
contractions per minute, restoring cardiac output to normal levels. Vasoconstriction of the arterioles increases vascular

Treatmentsgenerallyinvolveprovidingintravenousfluidstorestorethepatienttonormalfunctionandvariousdrugs
such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine to raise blood pressure.
• Cardiogenic shock results from the inability of the heart to maintain cardiac output. Most often, it results from a
myocardial infarction (heart attack), but it may also be caused by arrhythmias, valve disorders, cardiomyopathies,
cardiac failure, or simply insufficient flow of blood through the cardiac vessels. Treatment involves repairing the
damage to the heart or its vessels to resolve the underlying cause, rather than treating cardiogenic shock directly.

Pulmonary Circulation
Recall that blood returning from the systemic circuit enters the right atrium (Figure 20.23) via the superior and inferior
venae cavae and the coronary sinus, which drains the blood supply of the heart muscle. These vessels will be described

semilunar valve, which prevents backflow of blood into the right ventricle during ventricular diastole. As the pulmonary
trunk reaches the superior surface of the heart, it curves posteriorly and rapidly bifurcates (divides) into two branches,
a left and a right pulmonary artery. To prevent confusion between these vessels, it is important to refer to the vessel
exiting the heart as the pulmonary trunk, rather than also calling it a pulmonary artery. The pulmonary arteries in turn

The Aorta
The aorta is the largest artery in the body (Figure 20.25). It arises from the left ventricle and eventually descends to
the abdominal region, where it bifurcates at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra into the two common iliac arteries.
The aorta consists of the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending aorta, which passes through the diaphragm
and a landmark that divides into the superior thoracic and inferior abdominal components. Arteries originating from the
aorta ultimately distribute blood to virtually all tissues of the body. At the base of the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve
that prevents backflow of blood into the left ventricle while the heart is relaxing. After exiting the heart, the ascending

Aortic Arch Branches
There are three major branches of the aortic arch: the brachiocephalic artery, the left common carotid artery, and the left
subclavian (literally “under the clavicle”) artery. As you would expect based upon proximity to the heart, each of these
vessels is classified as an elastic artery.

the brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery arises directly from the aortic arch. The external carotid
artery supplies blood to numerous structures within the face, lower jaw, neck, esophagus, and larynx. These branches

The internal carotid arteries along with the vertebral arteries are the two primary suppliers of blood to the human brain.
Given the central role and vital importance of the brain to life, it is critical that blood supply to this organ remains
uninterrupted. Recall that blood flow to the brain is remarkably constant, with approximately 20 percent of blood flow
directedtothisorganatanygiventime.Whenbloodflowisinterrupted,evenforjustafewseconds,atransientischemic
attack(TIA),ormini-stroke,mayoccur,resultinginlossofconsciousnessortemporarylossofneurologicalfunction.In
some cases, the damage may be permanent. Loss of blood flow for longer periods, typically between 3 and 4 minutes,
will likely produce irreversible brain damage or a stroke, also called a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The locations
of the arteries in the brain not only provide blood flow to the brain tissue but also prevent interruption in the flow of
blood.Boththecarotidandvertebralarteriesbranchoncetheyenterthecranialcavity,andsomeofthesebranchesforma

The initial segments of the anterior cerebral arteries and the anterior communicating artery form the anterior portion of

the bronchial arteries, pericardial arteries, esophageal arteries, and the mediastinal arteries, each named after the tissues
it supplies. Each bronchial artery (typically two on the left and one on the right) supplies systemic blood to the lungs

However, keep this variation in mind when you move from the classroom to clinical practice.
Inboththeneckandlimbregions,thereareoftenbothsuperficialanddeeperlevelsofveins.Thedeeperveinsgenerally
correspond to the complementary arteries. The superficial veins do not normally have direct arterial counterparts, but in
addition to returning blood, they also make contributions to the maintenance of body temperature. When the ambient
temperature is warm, more blood is diverted to the superficial veins where heat can be more easily dissipated to the
environment.Incolderweather,thereismoreconstrictionofthesuperficialveinsandbloodisdiverteddeeperwherethe

Venous Drainage of the Brain
Circulation to the brain is both critical and complex (see Figure 20.37). Many smaller veins of the brain stem and the
superficial veins of the cerebrum lead to larger vessels referred to as intracranial sinuses. These include the superior and
inferior sagittal sinuses, straight sinus, cavernous sinuses, left and right sinuses, the petrosal sinuses, and the occipital
sinuses. Ultimately, sinuses will lead back to either the inferior jugular vein or vertebral vein.

The Inferior Vena Cava
Other than the small amount of blood drained by the azygos and hemiazygos veins, most of the blood inferior to the
diaphragm drains into the inferior vena cava before it is returned to the heart (see Figure 20.36). Lying just beneath the
parietal peritoneum in the abdominal cavity, the inferior vena cava parallels the abdominal aorta, where it can receive

20.6 | Development of Blood Vessels and Fetal Circulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the development of blood vessels
• Describe the fetal circulation
Inadevelopingembryo,thehearthasdevelopedenoughbyday21post-fertilizationtobeginbeating.Circulationpatterns
are clearly established by the fourth week of embryonic life. It is critical to the survival of the developing human that
the circulatory system forms early to supply the growing tissue with nutrients and gases, and to remove waste products.
Bloodcellsandvesselproductioninstructuresoutsidetheembryopropercalledtheyolksac,chorion,andconnectingstalk

precursor cells are known as hemangioblasts. These in turn differentiate into angioblasts, which give rise to the blood
vesselsandpluripotentstemcells,whichdifferentiateintotheformedelementsofblood.(Seekadditionalcontentformore

blood vessels from existing ones—continues as needed throughout life as we grow and develop.
Bloodvesseldevelopmentoftenfollowsthesamepatternasnervedevelopmentandtravelstothesametargettissuesand
organs. This occurs because the many factors directing growth of nerves also stimulate blood vessels to follow a similar
pattern. Whether a given vessel develops into an artery or a vein is dependent upon local concentrations of signaling
proteins.
Astheembryogrowswithinthemother’suterus,itsrequirementsfornutrientsandgasexchangealsogrow.Theplacenta—a
circulatory organ unique to pregnancy—develops jointly from the embryo and uterine wall structures to fill this need.
Emerging from the placenta is the umbilical vein, which carries oxygen-rich blood from the mother to the fetal inferior
vena cava via the ductus venosus to the heart that pumps it into fetal circulation. Two umbilical arteries carry oxygen-

depletedfetalblood,includingwastesandcarbondioxide,totheplacenta.Remnantsoftheumbilicalarteriesremaininthe
adult. (Seek additional content for more information on the role of the placenta in fetal circulation.)
There arethree major shunts—alternate paths forbloodflow—foundinthecirculatory system ofthefetus. Twoofthese
shuntsdivertbloodfromthepulmonarytothesystemiccircuit,whereasthethirdconnectstheumbilicalveintotheinferior
vena cava. The first two shunts are critical during fetal life, when the lungs are compressed, filled with amniotic fluid,
and nonfunctional, and gas exchange is provided by the placenta. These shunts close shortly after birth, however, when
thenewbornbeginstobreathe.Thethirdshuntpersistsabitlongerbutbecomesnonfunctionaloncetheumbilicalcordis
severed. The three shunts are as follows (Figure 20.44):

the fetal lungs to maintain the developing lung tissue. When the newborn takes the first breath, pressure within the

the smooth muscles in the wall of the ductus arteriosus constrict, sealing off the passage. Eventually, the muscular

• Theductusvenosusisatemporarybloodvesselthatbranchesfromtheumbilicalvein,allowingmuchofthefreshly
oxygenated blood from the placenta—the organ of gas exchange between the mother and fetus—to bypass the fetal
liver and go directly to the fetal heart. The ductus venosus closes slowly during the first weeks of infancy and
degenerates to become the ligamentum venosum.

CHAPTER REVIEW
20.1Structure and Function of Blood Vessels
Blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins
before returning to the heart. Arteries transport blood away from the heart and branch into smaller vessels, forming

vessels can be dramatically influenced by vasoconstriction and vasodilation in their walls.
20.2Blood Flow, Blood Pressure, and Resistance
Blood flowisthemovement ofbloodthroughavessel, tissue, ororgan.Theslowing orblocking ofbloodflowiscalled
resistance.Bloodpressureistheforcethatbloodexertsuponthewallsofthebloodvesselsorchambersoftheheart.The
componentsofbloodpressureincludesystolicpressure,whichresultsfromventricularcontraction,anddiastolicpressure,
which results from ventricular relaxation. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic measures, and
mean arterial pressure is the “average” pressure of blood in the arterial system, driving blood into the tissues. Pulse, the
expansion and recoiling of an artery, reflects the heartbeat. The variables affecting blood flow and blood pressure in the
systemic circulation are cardiac output, compliance, blood volume, blood viscosity, and the length and diameter of the
blood vessels. In the arterial system, vasodilation and vasoconstriction of the arterioles is a significant factor in systemic
bloodpressure:Slightvasodilationgreatlydecreasesresistanceandincreasesflow,whereasslightvasoconstrictiongreatly
increases resistance and decreases flow. In the arterial system, as resistance increases, blood pressure increases and flow
decreases.Inthevenoussystem,constrictionincreasesbloodpressureasitdoesinarteries;theincreasingpressurehelpsto
returnbloodtotheheart.Inaddition,constrictioncausesthevessellumentobecomemorerounded,decreasingresistance
and increasing blood flow. Venoconstriction, while less important than arterial vasoconstriction, works with the skeletal
muscle pump, the respiratory pump, and their valves to promote venous return to the heart.
20.3Capillary Exchange
Small molecules can cross into and out of capillaries via simple or facilitated diffusion. Some large molecules can cross
in vesicles or through clefts, fenestrations, or gaps between cells in capillary walls. However, the bulk flow of capillary
andtissuefluidoccursviafiltrationandreabsorption.Filtration,themovementoffluidoutofthecapillaries,isdrivenby
theCHP.Reabsorption,theinfluxoftissuefluidintothecapillaries,isdrivenbytheBCOP.Filtrationpredominatesinthe
arterialendofthecapillary;inthemiddlesection,theopposingpressuresarevirtuallyidenticalsothereisnonetexchange,
whereasreabsorptionpredominatesatthevenuleendofthecapillary.Thehydrostaticandcolloidosmoticpressuresinthe
interstitial fluid are negligible in healthy circumstances.
20.4Homeostatic Regulation of the Vascular System
Neural,endocrine,andautoregulatorymechanismsaffectbloodflow,bloodpressure,andeventuallyperfusionofbloodto
body tissues. Neural mechanisms include the cardiovascular centers in the medulla oblongata, baroreceptors in the aorta
andcarotidarteriesandrightatrium,andassociatedchemoreceptorsthatmonitorbloodlevelsofoxygen,carbondioxide,
and hydrogen ions. Endocrine controls include epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as ADH, the renin-angiotensin-
aldosteronemechanism,ANH,andEPO.Autoregulationisthelocalcontrolofvasodilationandconstrictionbychemical
signalsandthemyogenicresponse.Exercisegreatlyimprovescardiovascularfunctionandreducestheriskofcardiovascular
diseases, including hypertension, a leading cause of heart attacks and strokes. Significant hemorrhage can lead to a form
of circulatory shock known as hypovolemic shock. Sepsis, obstruction, and widespread inflammation can also cause
circulatory shock.
20.5Circulatory Pathways
The right ventricle pumps oxygen-depleted blood into the pulmonary trunk and right and left pulmonary arteries, which

The left ventricle pumps this blood into the aorta. The main regions of the aorta are the ascending aorta, aortic arch,
and descending aorta, which is further divided into the thoracic and abdominal aorta. The coronary arteries branch from
the ascending aorta. After oxygenating tissues in the capillaries, systemic blood is returned to the right atrium from the

Introduction
Chapter Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• Identify the components and anatomy of the lymphatic system
926 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM
• Discuss the role of the innate immune response against pathogens
• Describe the power of the adaptive immune response to cure disease
• Explain immunological deficiencies and over-reactions of the immune system
• Discuss the role of the immune response in transplantation and cancer
• Describe the interaction of the immune and lymphatic systems with other body systems
InJune1981,theCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention(CDC),inAtlanta,Georgia,publishedareportofanunusual

Pneumocystis jirovecii(formerly known asPneumocystis carinii).
Why was this unusual? Although commonly found in the lungs of healthy individuals, this fungus is an opportunistic
pathogenthatcausesdiseaseinindividualswithsuppressedorunderdevelopedimmunesystems.Theveryyoung,whose
immune systems have yet to mature, and the elderly, whose immune systems have declined with age, are particularly

more severe, with multiple, fast-growing lesions that spread to all parts of the body, including the trunk and face. Could
the immune systems of these young patients have been compromised in some way? Indeed, when they were tested, they
exhibited extremely low numbers of a specific type of white blood cell in their bloodstreams, indicating that they had
somehow lost a major part of the immune system.

became focused as never before on the importance of having a functional and healthy immune system.
21.1 | Anatomy of the Lymphatic and Immune Systems
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the structure and function of the lymphatic tissue (lymph fluid, vessels, ducts, and organs)
• Describe the structure and function of the primary and secondary lymphatic organs
• Discuss the cells of the immune system, how they function, and their relationship with the lymphatic system
The immune system is the complex collection of cells and organs that destroys or neutralizes pathogens that would
otherwisecausediseaseordeath.Thelymphaticsystem,formostpeople,isassociatedwiththeimmunesystemtosucha

fluid. Of this, 17 liters is reabsorbed directly by the blood vessels. But what happens to the remaining three liters? This
is where the lymphatic system comes into play. It drains the excess fluid and empties it back into the bloodstream via a

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 927
Cells of the immune system not only use lymphatic vessels to make their way from interstitial spaces back into the
circulation, but they also use lymph nodes as major staging areas for the development of critical immune responses. A
lymph nodeis one of the small, bean-shaped organs located throughout the lymphatic system.

three main components of the lymphatic system?
Structure of the Lymphatic System
Thelymphaticvesselsbeginasopen-endedcapillaries,whichfeedintolargerandlargerlymphaticvessels,andeventually
empty into the bloodstream by a series of ducts. Along the way, the lymph travels through the lymph nodes, which are
commonlyfoundnearthegroin,armpits,neck,chest,andabdomen.Humanshaveabout500–600lymphnodesthroughout
the body (Figure 21.2).
928 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM
Figure21.2AnatomyoftheLymphaticSystem Lymphaticvesselsinthearmsandlegsconveylymphtothelarger
lymphatic vessels in the torso.
A major distinction between the lymphatic and cardiovascular systems in humans is that lymph is not actively pumped
by the heart, but is forced through the vessels by the movements of the body, the contraction of skeletal muscles during
bodymovements,andbreathing.One-wayvalves(semi-lunarvalves)inlymphaticvesselskeepthelymphmovingtoward
theheart.Lymphflowsfromthelymphaticcapillaries,throughlymphaticvessels,andthenisdumpedintothecirculatory
system via the lymphatic ducts located at the junction of the jugular and subclavian veins in the neck.
Lymphatic Capillaries
Lymphaticcapillaries,alsocalledtheterminallymphatics,arevesselswhereinterstitialfluidentersthelymphaticsystem
to become lymph fluid. Located in almost every tissue in the body, these vessels are interlaced among the arterioles and
venulesofthecirculatorysysteminthesoftconnectivetissuesofthebody(Figure21.3).Exceptionsarethecentralnervous

cardiovascularsystem.Collagenfibersanchoralymphaticcapillaryinthetissue(inset).Interstitialfluidslipsthrough
spaces between the overlapping endothelial cells that compose the lymphatic capillary.
Lymphatic capillaries are formed by a one cell-thick layer of endothelial cells and represent the open end of the system,
allowing interstitial fluid to flow into them via overlapping cells (see Figure 21.3). When interstitial pressure is low, the
endothelial flaps close to prevent “backflow.” As interstitial pressure increases, the spaces between the cells open up,
allowing the fluid to enter. Entry of fluid into lymphatic capillaries is also enabled by the collagen filaments that anchor
thecapillaries tosurroundingstructures.Asinterstitial pressureincreases,thefilaments pullontheendothelial cellflaps,
opening up them even further to allow easy entry of fluid.

lymphoid organs. A naïve lymphocyte is one that has left the primary organ and entered a secondary lymphoid organ.
Naïve lymphocytes are fully functional immunologically, but have yet to encounter an antigen to respond to. In addition
to circulating in the blood and lymph, lymphocytes concentrate in secondary lymphoid organs, which include the lymph
nodes, spleen, and lymphoid nodules. All of these tissues have many features in common, including the following:

transported toaregional lymph node.Dendritic cells andmacrophages within this organinternalize andkill many ofthe
pathogens that pass through, thereby removing them from the body. The lymph node is also the site of adaptive immune
responses mediated by T cells, B cells, and accessory cells of the adaptive immune system. Like the thymus, the bean-
shaped lymph nodes are surrounded by a tough capsule of connective tissue and are separated into compartments by
trabeculae,theextensionsofthecapsule.Inadditiontothestructureprovidedbythecapsuleandtrabeculae,thestructural

• Show how the innate immune response is important and how it helps guide and prepare the body for adaptive
immune responses
• Describe various soluble factors that are part of the innate immune response

Figure 21.12 Cooperation between Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses The innate immune system
enhances adaptive immune responses so they can be more effective.
Any discussion of the innate immune response usually begins with the physical barriers that prevent pathogens from
entering the body, destroy them after they enter, or flush them out before they can establish themselves in the hospitable
environmentofthebody’ssofttissues.Barrierdefensesarepartofthebody’smostbasicdefensemechanisms.Thebarrier
defenses are not a response to infections, but they are continuously working to protect against a broad range of pathogens.
Thedifferentmodesofbarrierdefensesareassociatedwiththeexternalsurfacesofthebody,wherepathogensmaytryto

breached barrier defenses and have entered the vulnerable tissues of the body.
Phagocytes: Macrophages and Neutrophils
Many of the cells of the immune system have a phagocytic ability, at least at some point during their life cycles.
Phagocytosis is an important and effective mechanism of destroying pathogens during innate immune responses. The
phagocyte takes the organism inside itself as a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with a lysosome and its digestive
enzymes, effectively killing many pathogens. On the other hand, some bacteria including Mycobacteria tuberculosis, the
cause of tuberculosis, may be resistant to these enzymes and are therefore much more difficult to clear from the body.
Macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells are the major phagocytes of the immune system.
Amacrophageisanirregularly shapedphagocyte that isamoeboid innature andisthemostversatile ofthephagocytes
in the body. Macrophages move through tissues and squeeze through capillary walls using pseudopodia. They not only
participate in innate immune responses but have also evolved to cooperate with lymphocytes as part of the adaptive
immune response. Macrophages exist in many tissues of the body, either freely roaming through connective tissues or
fixedtoreticular fiberswithin specific tissues suchaslymphnodes.Whenpathogens breach thebody’sbarrier defenses,

Cells of the innate immune response, the phagocytic cells, and the cytotoxic NK cells recognize patterns of pathogen-

todestroytheoffendingmicrobe.Receptors varysomewhataccordingtocelltype,buttheyusuallyincludereceptorsfor
bacterial components and for complement, discussed below.
Soluble Mediators of the Innate Immune Response
The previous discussions have alluded to chemical signals that can induce cells to change various physiological
characteristics, such as the expression of a particular receptor. These soluble factors are secreted during innate or early
induced responses, and later during adaptive immune responses.
Cytokines and Chemokines
A cytokine is signaling molecule that allows cells to communicate with each other over short distances. Cytokines are
secreted intotheintercellular space, andtheaction ofthecytokine induces thereceiving cell tochange itsphysiology.A
chemokineisasolublechemicalmediatorsimilartocytokinesexceptthatitsfunctionistoattractcells(chemotaxis)from

942 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/chemotaxis) to learn about phagocyte chemotaxis. Phagocyte
chemotaxis is the movement of phagocytes according to the secretion of chemical messengers in the form of
interleukins and other chemokines. By what means does a phagocyte destroy a bacterium that it has ingested?
Early induced Proteins
Earlyinducedproteinsarethosethatarenotconstitutivelypresentinthebody,butaremadeastheyareneededearlyduring

interferons that travel to adjacent cells and induce them to make antiviral proteins. Thus, even though the initial cell is

the phagocytosis of the bacterium by the process known as opsonization. Opsonization is the tagging of a pathogen for
phagocytosis by the binding of an antibody or an antimicrobial protein.
Complement System
The complement system is a series of proteins constitutively found in the blood plasma. As such, these proteins are not
considered part of the early induced immune response, even though they share features with some of the antibacterial
proteinsofthisclass.Madeintheliver,theyhaveavarietyoffunctionsintheinnateimmuneresponse,usingwhatisknown
asthe“alternatepathway”ofcomplementactivation.Additionally,complementfunctionsintheadaptiveimmuneresponse
as well, in what is called the classical pathway. The complement system consists of several proteins that enzymatically
alter and fragment later proteins in a series, which is why it is termed cascade. Once activated, the series of reactions is
irreversible, and releases fragments that have the following actions:
• Bind to the cell membrane of the pathogen that activates it, labeling it for phagocytosis (opsonization)
• Diffuse away from the pathogen and act as chemotactic agents to attract phagocytic cells to the site of inflammation
• Form damaging pores in the plasma membrane of the pathogen
Figure 21.13 shows the classical pathway, which requires antibodies of the adaptive immune response. The alternate
pathway does not require an antibody to become activated.

autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.
There are four important parts to the inflammatory response:
• Tissue Injury. The released contents of injured cells stimulate the release of mast cell granules and their potent
inflammatory mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. Histamine increases the diameter of
local blood vessels (vasodilation), causing an increase in blood flow. Histamine also increases the permeability of
local capillaries, causing plasma to leak out and form interstitial fluid. This causes the swelling associated with
inflammation.
Additionally,injuredcells,phagocytes,andbasophilsaresourcesofinflammatorymediators,includingprostaglandins
andleukotrienes. Leukotrienes attract neutrophils fromthebloodbychemotaxis andincrease vascular permeability.
Prostaglandins cause vasodilation by relaxing vascular smooth muscle and are a major cause of the pain associated
with inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen relieve pain by inhibiting
prostaglandin production.
• Vasodilation. Many inflammatory mediators such as histamine are vasodilators that increase the diameters of local
capillaries.Thiscausesincreasedbloodflowandisresponsiblefortheheatandrednessofinflamedtissue.Itallows
greater access of the blood to the site of inflammation.
• Increased Vascular Permeability. At the same time, inflammatory mediators increase the permeability of the local
vasculature, causing leakage of fluid into the interstitial space, resulting in the swelling, or edema, associated with
inflammation.
• Recruitment of Phagocytes. Leukotrienes are particularly good at attracting neutrophils from the blood to the site
of infection by chemotaxis. Following an early neutrophil infiltrate stimulated by macrophage cytokines, more

facilitates the transport of antigen to lymph nodes by dendritic cells for the development of the adaptive immune response.
21.3 | The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes
and Their Functional Types
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the advantages of the adaptive immune response over the innate immune response
• List the various characteristics of an antigen
• Describe the types of T cell antigen receptors
• Outline the steps of T cell development
• Describe the major T cell types and their functions
Innateimmuneresponses(andearlyinducedresponses)areinmanycasesineffectiveatcompletelycontrollingpathogen
growth. However, they slow pathogen growth and allow time for the adaptive immune response to strengthen and either
controloreliminatethepathogen.Theinnateimmunesystemalsosendssignalstothecellsoftheadaptiveimmunesystem,
guiding them in how to attack the pathogen. Thus, these are the two important arms of the immune response.
The Benefits of the Adaptive Immune Response
The specificity of the adaptive immune response—its ability to specifically recognize and make a response against a
wide variety of pathogens—is its great strength. Antigens, the small chemical groups often associated with pathogens,
are recognized by receptors on the surface of B and T lymphocytes. The adaptive immune response to these antigens is
so versatile that it can respond to nearly any pathogen. This increase in specificity comes because the adaptive immune
response has a unique way to develop as many as 1011, or 100 trillion, different receptors to recognize nearly every
conceivablepathogen.Howcouldsomanydifferenttypesofantibodiesbeencoded?Andwhataboutthemanyspecificities

worked out in the 1970s and 1980s using the new tools of molecular genetics
Primary Disease and Immunological Memory
Theimmunesystem’sfirstexposuretoapathogeniscalledaprimaryadaptiveresponse.Symptomsofafirstinfection,
called primary disease, are always relatively severe because it takes time for an initial adaptive immune response to a
pathogen to become effective.
Uponre-exposuretothesamepathogen,asecondaryadaptiveimmuneresponseisgenerated,whichisstrongerandfaster
that the primary response. The secondary adaptive response often eliminates a pathogen before it can cause significant
tissue damage or any symptoms. Without symptoms, there is no disease, and the individual is not even aware of the
infection. This secondary response is the basis of immunological memory, which protects us from getting diseases
repeatedlyfromthesamepathogen.Bythismechanism,anindividual’sexposuretopathogensearlyinlifesparestheperson
from these diseases later in life.
Self Recognition

away from the T cell membrane and is so named because its amino acid sequence varies between receptors. In contrast,
the constant region domain has less variation. The differences in the amino acid sequences of the variable domains are
the molecular basis of the diversity of antigens the receptor can recognize. Thus, the antigen-binding site of the receptor

its antigenic specificity. Each T cell produces only one type of receptor and thus is specific for a single particular antigen.

Professional Antigen-presenting Cells
Many cell types express class Imolecules forthe presentation ofintracellular antigens. These MHC molecules may then
stimulate a cytotoxic T cell immune response, eventually destroying the cell and the pathogen within. This is especially
importantwhenitcomestothemostcommonclassofintracellularpathogens,thevirus.Virusesinfectnearlyeverytissue
of the body, so all these tissues must necessarily be able to express class I MHC or no T cell response can be made.
On the other hand, class II MHC molecules are expressed only on the cells of the immune system, specifically cells that
affectotherarmsoftheimmuneresponse.Thus,thesecellsarecalled“professional”antigen-presentingcellstodistinguish
themfromthosethatbearclassIMHC.Thethreetypesofprofessionalantigenpresentersaremacrophages,dendriticcells,
and B cells (Table 21.4).
Macrophages stimulate T cells to release cytokines that enhance phagocytosis. Dendritic cells also kill pathogens by
phagocytosis (see Figure 21.17), but their major function is to bring antigens to regional draining lymph nodes. The
lymph nodes are the locations in which most T cell responses against pathogens of the interstitial tissues are mounted.
Macrophages are found in the skin and in the lining of mucosal surfaces, such as the nasopharynx, stomach, lungs, and

CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM 951
Mechanisms of T Cell-mediated Immune Responses
Mature T cells become activated by recognizing processed foreign antigen in association with a self-MHC molecule and
begin dividing rapidly by mitosis. This proliferation of T cells is called clonal expansion and is necessary to make the
immune response strong enough to effectively control a pathogen. How does the body select only those T cells that are
neededagainstaspecificpathogen?Again,thespecificity ofaTcellisbasedontheaminoacidsequenceandthethree-
dimensionalshapeoftheantigen-bindingsiteformedbythevariableregionsofthetwochainsoftheTcellreceptor(Figure

Each T cell that is activated has a specific receptor “hard-wired” into its DNA, and all of its progeny will have identical
DNA and T cell receptors, forming clones of the original T cell.

receptors, called clones. The clones with receptors specific for antigens on the pathogen are selected for and

the body will have large numbers of specific lymphocytes available to fight the infection (seeFigure 21.19).
The Cellular Basis of Immunological Memory
As already discussed, one of the major features of an adaptive immune response is the development of immunological
memory.
952 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM
Duringaprimaryadaptiveimmuneresponse,bothmemoryTcellsandeffectorTcellsaregenerated.MemoryTcellsare
long-lived and can even persist for a lifetime. Memory cells are primed to act rapidly. Thus, any subsequent exposure to
the pathogen will elicit a very rapid T cell response. This rapid, secondary adaptive response generates large numbers of
effectorTcellssofastthatthepathogenisoftenoverwhelmedbeforeitcancauseanysymptomsofdisease.Thisiswhat
ismeantbyimmunitytoadisease.ThesamepatternofprimaryandsecondaryimmuneresponsesoccursinBcellsandthe
antibody response, as will be discussed later in the chapter.
T Cell Types and their Functions
In the discussion of T cell development, you saw that mature T cells express either the CD4 marker or the CD8 marker,
butnotboth.These markers are cell adhesion molecules that keep the Tcell inclose contact with the antigen-presenting
cellbydirectlybindingtotheMHCmolecule(toadifferentpartofthemoleculethandoestheantigen).Thus,Tcellsand
antigen-presentingcellsareheldtogetherintwoways:byCD4orCD8attachingtoMHCandbytheTcellreceptorbinding
to antigen (Figure 21.20).
Figure 21.20 Pathogen Presentation (a) CD4 is associated with helper and regulatory T cells. An extracellular

Not only do T cells directly destroy pathogens, but they regulate nearly all other types of the adaptive immune response
as well, as evidenced by the functions of the T cell types, their surface markers, the cells they work on, and the types of
pathogens they work against (seeTable 21.5).

21.4 | The Adaptive Immune Response: B-lymphocytes
and Antibodies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain how B cells mature and how B cell tolerance develops
• Discuss how B cells are activated and differentiate into plasma cells
• Describe the structure of the antibody classes and their functions
Antibodies were the first component of the adaptive immune response to be characterized by scientists working on the
immune system. It was already known that individuals who survived a bacterial infection were immune to re-infection
withthesamepathogen.Earlymicrobiologiststookserumfromanimmunepatientandmixeditwithafreshcultureofthe
same type of bacteria, then observed the bacteria under a microscope. The bacteria became clumped in a process called
agglutination.Whenadifferentbacterialspecieswasused,theagglutinationdidnothappen.Thus,therewassomethingin
the serum of immune individuals that could specifically bind to and agglutinate bacteria.
Scientists now know the cause of the agglutination is an antibody molecule, also called an immunoglobulin. What is
an antibody? An antibody protein is essentially a secreted form of a B cell receptor. (In fact, surface immunoglobulin is

954 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM
There are five different classes of antibody found in humans: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE. Each of these has specific
functions in the immune response, so by learning about them, researchers can learn about the great variety of antibody
functions critical to many adaptive immune responses.

signaledtocommitsuicidebyapoptosis,removingthemfromthepopulation.Intheprocessofclonalanergy,however,B
cells exposed to soluble antigen in the bone marrow are not physically deleted, but become unable to function.
Another mechanism called peripheral tolerance is a direct result of T cell tolerance. In peripheral tolerance, functional,
mature B cells leave the bone marrow but have yet to be exposed to self-antigen. Most protein antigens require signals
fromhelperTcells(Th2)toproceedtomakeantibody.WhenaBcellbindstoaself-antigenbutreceivesnosignalsfroma

of the control that T cells have over the adaptive immune response.
After B cells are activated by their binding to antigen, they differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma cells often leave the
secondary lymphoid organs, where the response is generated, and migrate back to the bone marrow, where the whole
differentiationprocessstarted.Aftersecretingantibodiesforaspecificperiod,theydie,asmostoftheirenergyisdevoted

because class switching occurs during primary responses. IgG is a monomeric antibody that clears pathogens from the

Clonal Selection of B Cells
Clonal selection and expansion work much the same way in B cells as in T cells. Only B cells with appropriate antigen
specificity are selected for and expanded (Figure 21.23). Eventually, the plasma cells secrete antibodies with antigenic
specificityidenticaltothosethatwereonthesurfacesoftheselectedBcells.Noticeinthefigurethatbothplasmacellsand

example of natural immunity acquired passively?
T cell-dependent versus T cell-independent Antigens
As discussed previously, Th2 cells secrete cytokines that drive the production of antibodies in a B cell, responding to
complex antigens such as those made by proteins. On the other hand, some antigens are T cell independent. A T cell-
independent antigen usually is in the form of repeated carbohydrate moieties found on the cell walls of bacteria. Each
antibody on the B cell surface has two binding sites, and the repeated nature of T cell-independent antigen leads to
crosslinking of the surface antibodies on the B cell. The crosslinking is enough to activate it in the absence of T cell
cytokines.
A T cell-dependent antigen, on the other hand, usually is not repeated to the same degree on the pathogen and thus
doesnotcrosslinksurfaceantibodywiththesameefficiency.Toelicitaresponsetosuchantigens,theBandTcellsmust

The Mucosal Immune Response
Mucosal tissues are major barriers to the entry of pathogens into the body. The IgA (and sometimes IgM) antibodies in
mucus and other secretions can bind to the pathogen, and in the cases of many viruses and bacteria, neutralize them.
Neutralization is the process ofcoating a pathogen with antibodies, making it physically impossible forthe pathogen to
bindtoreceptors.Neutralization,whichoccursintheblood,lymph,andotherbodyfluidsandsecretions,protectsthebody
constantly. Neutralizing antibodies are the basis for the disease protection offered by vaccines. Vaccinations for diseases

Evasion of the Immune System by Pathogens
It is important to keep in mind that although the immune system has evolved to be able to control many pathogens,
pathogens themselves have evolved ways to evade the immune response. An example already mentioned is in
Mycobactrium tuberculosis, which has evolved a complex cell wall that is resistant to the digestive enzymes of the
macrophages thatingestthem,andthuspersistsinthehost,causingthechronicdiseasetuberculosis. Thissectionbriefly
summarizes other ways in which pathogens can “outwit” immune responses. But keep in mind, although it seems as if
pathogens have a will of their own, they do not. All of these evasive “strategies” arose strictly by evolution, driven by
selection.
Bacteria sometimes evade immune responses because they exist in multiple strains, such as different groups of
Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus is commonly found in minor skin infections, such as boils, and some healthy people
harboritintheirnose.Onesmall groupofstrains ofthisbacterium, however,called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus, has become resistant to multiple antibiotics and is essentially untreatable. Different bacterial strains differ in the
antigens on their surfaces. The immune response against one strain (antigen) does not affect the other; thus, the species
survives.
Another method of immune evasion is mutation. Because viruses’ surface molecules mutate continuously, viruses like
influenza change enougheach yearthat thefluvaccine foroneyearmaynotprotect against theflucommon tothenext.
New vaccine formulations must be derived for each flu season.
Genetic recombination—the combining of gene segments from two different pathogens—is an efficient form of immune
evasion.Forexample,theinfluenzaviruscontainsgenesegmentsthatcanrecombinewhentwodifferentvirusesinfectthe
same cell. Recombination between human and pig influenza viruses led to the 2010 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.
Pathogenscanproduceimmunosuppressivemoleculesthatimpairimmunefunction,andthereareseveraldifferenttypes.
Viruses are especially good at evading the immune response in this way, and many types of viruses have been shown to
suppress the host immune response in ways much more subtle than the wholesale destruction caused by HIV.

Althoughmanyvirusescausesuppressionoftheimmunesystem,onlyonewipesitoutcompletely,andthatisthepreviously

and reproduce. Given that CD4+ helper T cells play an important role in other in T cell immune responses and antibody
responses, it should be no surprise that both types of immune responses are eventually seriously compromised.

for this discussion to use the four types of hypersensitivities as a guide to understand these mechanisms (Figure 21.28).
964 CHAPTER 21 | THE LYMPHATIC AND IMMUNE SYSTEM
Figure 21.28 Immune Hypersensitivity Components of the immune system cause four types of hypersensitivity.
Notice that types I–III are B cell mediated, whereas type IV hypersensitivity is exclusively a T cell phenomenon.
Immediate (Type I) Hypersensitivity
Antigensthatcauseallergicresponsesareoftenreferredtoasallergens.Thespecificityoftheimmediatehypersensitivity
responseispredicatedonthebindingofallergen-specificIgEtothemastcellsurface.Theprocessofproducingallergen-
specific IgE is called sensitization, and is a necessary prerequisite for the symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity to
occur. Allergies and allergic asthma are mediated by mast cell degranulation that is caused by the crosslinking of the
antigen-specific IgE molecules on the mast cell surface. The mediators released have various vasoactive effects already
discussed, but the major symptoms of inhaled allergens are the nasal edema and runny nose caused by the increased
vascular permeability and increased blood flow of nasal blood vessels. As these mediators are released with mast cell
degranulation, type I hypersensitivity reactions are usually rapid and occur within just a few minutes, hence the term
immediate hypersensitivity.
Mostallergensareinthemselvesnonpathogenicandthereforeinnocuous.Someindividualsdevelopmildallergies,which
are usually treated with antihistamines. Others develop severe allergies that may cause anaphylactic shock, which can
potentially be fatal within 20 to 30 minutes if untreated. This drop in blood pressure (shock) with accompanying
contractions of bronchial smooth muscle is caused by systemic mast cell degranulation when an allergen is eaten (for
example, shellfish and peanuts), injected (by a bee sting or being administered penicillin), or inhaled (asthma). Because
epinephrine raises blood pressure and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, it is routinely used to counteract the effects of
anaphylaxis and can be lifesaving. Patients with known severe allergies are encouraged to keep automatic epinephrine
injectors with them at all times, especially when away from easy access to hospitals.

Delayed (Type IV) Hypersensitivity
Delayed hypersensitivity, or type IV hypersensitivity, is basically a standard cellular immune response. In delayed
hypersensitivity, the first exposure to an antigen is called sensitization, such that on re-exposure, a secondary cellular

There are genetic factors in autoimmune diseases as well. Some diseases are associated with the MHC genes that an
individual expresses. The reason for this association is likely because if one’s MHC molecules are not able to present
a certain self-antigen, then that particular autoimmune disease cannot occur. Overall, there are more than 80 different
autoimmune diseases, whichareasignificant health problemintheelderly.Table21.7listsseveral ofthemostcommon

ImmunosuppressivedrugssuchascyclosporineAhavemadetransplantsmoresuccessful,butmatchingtheMHCmolecules
is still key. In humans, there are six MHC molecules that show the most polymorphisms, three class I molecules (A, B,
and C) and three class II molecules called DP, DQ, and DR. A successful transplant usually requires a match between
at least 3–4 of these molecules, with more matches associated with greater success. Family members, since they share a
similar genetic background, are much more likely to share MHC molecules than unrelated individuals do. In fact, due to
theextensivepolymorphismsintheseMHCmolecules,unrelateddonorsarefoundonlythroughaworldwidedatabase.The
systemisnotfoolproofhowever,astherearenotenoughindividualsinthesystemtoprovidetheorgansnecessarytotreat
all patients needing them.
One disease of transplantation occurs with bone marrow transplants, which are used to treat various diseases, including
SCID and leukemia. Because the bone marrow cells being transplanted contain lymphocytes capable of mounting an
immune response, and because the recipient’s immune response has been destroyed before receiving the transplant, the
donor cells may attack the recipient tissues, causing graft-versus-host disease. Symptoms of this disease, which usually
includearashanddamagetotheliverandmucosa,arevariable,andattemptshavebeenmadetomoderatethediseaseby
first removing mature T cells from the donor bone marrow before transplanting it.

cancer and actively kills most cancer cells, followed by a period of controlled equilibrium during which the remaining
cancercellsareheldincheck.Unfortunately,manycancersmutate,sotheynolongerexpressanyspecificantigensforthe
immune system to respond to, and a subpopulation of cancer cells escapes the immune response, continuing the disease
process.
This fact has led to extensive research in trying to develop ways to enhance the early immune response to completely
eliminate theearly cancer andthusprevent alater escape. Onemethod that hasshownsomesuccess istheuseofcancer
vaccines, which differ from viral and bacterial vaccines in that they are directed against the cells of one’s own body.
Treated cancer cells are injected into cancer patients to enhance their anti-cancer immune response and thereby prolong
survival. The immune system has the capability to detect these cancer cells and proliferate faster than the cancer cells

Theimmunesystemcannotexistinisolation.Afterall,ithastoprotecttheentirebodyfrominfection.Therefore,the
immunesystemisrequiredtointeractwithotherorgansystems,sometimesincomplexways.Thirtyyearsofresearch
focusing on the connections between the immune system, the central nervous system, and the endocrine system
have led to a new science with the unwieldy name of called psychoneuroimmunology. The physical connections
betweenthesesystemshavebeenknownforcenturies:Allprimaryandsecondaryorgansareconnectedtosympathetic

One well-established interaction of the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems is the effect of stress on immune
health. In the human vertebrate evolutionary past, stress was associated with the fight-or-flight response, largely

At one time, it was assumed that all types of stress reduced all aspects of the immune response, but the last few
decadesofresearchhavepaintedadifferentpicture.First,mostshort-termstressdoesnotimpairtheimmunesystem

from the adaptive immune response, however, causes its own share of problems in fighting disease.
Chronic stress, unlike short-term stress, may inhibit immune responses even in otherwise healthy adults. The

21.3The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes and Their Functional Types
T cells recognize antigens with their antigen receptor, a complex of two protein chains on their surface. They do not
recognize self-antigens, however, but only processed antigen presented on their surfaces in a binding groove of a major
histocompatibility complex molecule. T cells develop in the thymus, where they learn to use self-MHC molecules to
recognize only foreign antigens, thus making them tolerant to self-antigens. There are several functional types of T
lymphocytes, the major ones being helper, regulatory, and cytotoxic T cells.

21.5The Immune Response against Pathogens
Early childhood is a time when the body develops much of its immunological memory that protects it from diseases in
adulthood. The components of the immune response that have the maximum effectiveness against a pathogen are often
associated with the class of pathogen involved. Bacteria and fungi are especially susceptible to damage by complement
proteins, whereas viruses are taken care of by interferons and cytotoxic T cells. Worms are attacked by eosinophils.

Introduction
Chapter Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• List the structures of the respiratory system
• List the major functions of the respiratory system
• Outline the forces that allow for air movement into and out of the lungs
• Outline the process of gas exchange
• Summarize the process of oxygen and carbon dioxide transport within the respiratory system
• Create a flow chart illustrating how respiration is controlled
• Discuss how the respiratory system responds to exercise
• Describe the development of the respiratory system in the embryo
Hold your breath. Really! See how long you can hold your breath as you continue reading…How long can you do it?
Chances are you are feeling uncomfortable already. A typical human cannot survive without breathing for more than 3
minutes, and even if you wanted to hold your breath longer, your autonomic nervous system would take control. This is
because every cell in the body needs to run the oxidative stages of cellular respiration, the process by which energy is

and carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. You may be surprised to learn that although oxygen is a critical need
for cells, it is actually the accumulation of carbon dioxide that primarily drives your need to breathe. Carbon dioxide is
exhaledandoxygenisinhaledthroughtherespiratorysystem,whichincludesmusclestomoveairintoandoutofthelungs,
passageways through which air moves, and microscopic gas exchange surfaces covered by capillaries. The circulatory

these conditions affect the gas exchange process and result in labored breathing and other difficulties.
22.1 | Organs and Structures of the Respiratory System
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• List the structures that make up the respiratory system
• Describe how the respiratory system processes oxygen and CO2
• Compare and contrast the functions of upper respiratory tract with the lower respiratory tract
The major organs of the respiratory system function primarily to provide oxygen to body tissues for cellular respiration,
remove the waste product carbon dioxide, and help to maintain acid-base balance. Portions of the respiratory system are
alsousedfornon-vitalfunctions,suchassensingodors,speechproduction,andforstraining,suchasduringchildbirthor
coughing (Figure 22.2).

The nasal septum is formed anteriorly by a portion of the septal cartilage (the flexible portion you can touch with your
fingers) and posteriorly by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone (a cranial bone located just posterior to the nasal
bones) and the thin vomer bones (whose name refers to its plough shape). Each lateral wall of the nasal cavity has three

In many cases, the underlying cause of the condition is unknown. However, recent research has demonstrated that
certain viruses, such as human rhinovirus C (HRVC), and the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia

Blood Supply
The major function of the lungs is to perform gas exchange, which requires blood from the pulmonary circulation. This
blood supply contains deoxygenated blood and travels to the lungs where erythrocytes, also known as red blood cells,
pick upoxygen to be transported to tissues throughout the body.The pulmonary artery is an artery that arises from the

capillaries branch and follow the bronchioles and structure of the alveoli. It is at this point that the capillary wall meets
the alveolar wall, creating the respiratory membrane. Once the blood is oxygenated, it drains from the alveoli by way of
multiple pulmonary veins, which exit the lungs through thehilum.
Nervous Innervation
Dilation and constriction of the airway are achieved through nervous control by the parasympathetic and sympathetic
nervous systems. The parasympathetic system causes bronchoconstriction, whereas the sympathetic nervous system

Pulmonaryventilationistheactofbreathing,whichcanbedescribedasthemovementofairintoandoutofthelungs.
Themajormechanismsthatdrivepulmonaryventilationareatmosphericpressure(Patm);theairpressurewithinthealveoli,
called alveolar pressure (Palv); and the pressure within the pleural cavity, called intrapleural pressure (Pip).
Mechanisms of Breathing
The alveolar and intrapleural pressures are dependent on certain physical features of the lung. However, the ability to
breathe—to haveairenterthelungsduringinspiration andairleavethelungsduringexpiration—is dependentontheair
pressure of the atmosphere and the air pressure within the lungs.
Pressure Relationships
Inspiration (or inhalation) and expiration (or exhalation) are dependent on the differences in pressure between the
atmosphere and the lungs. In a gas, pressure is a force created by the movement of gas molecules that are confined. For
example,acertainnumberofgasmoleculesinatwo-litercontainerhasmoreroomthanthesamenumberofgasmolecules
in a one-liter container (Figure 22.15). In this case, the force exerted by the movement of the gas molecules against the
walls ofthetwo-liter container islowerthantheforceexerted bythegasmolecules intheone-liter container.Therefore,
thepressureislowerinthetwo-litercontainerandhigherintheone-litercontainer.Ataconstanttemperature,changingthe
volume occupied by the gas changes the pressure, as does changing the number of gas molecules. Boyle’s law describes
the relationship between volume and pressure in a gas at a constant temperature. Boyle discovered that the pressure of a
gasisinverselyproportionaltoitsvolume:Ifvolumeincreases,pressuredecreases.Likewise,ifvolumedecreases,pressure
increases.Pressureandvolumeareinverselyrelated(P=k/V).Therefore,thepressureintheone-litercontainer(one-half

Pulmonaryventilationisdependentonthreetypesofpressure:atmospheric,intra-alveolar,andinterpleural.Atmospheric
pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface, such as the body.
Atmospheric pressure can be expressed in terms of the unit atmosphere, abbreviated atm, or in millimeters of mercury
(mmHg).Oneatmisequalto760mmHg,whichistheatmosphericpressureatsealevel.Typically,forrespiration,other
pressure values are discussed in relation to atmospheric pressure. Therefore, negative pressure is pressure lower than the

to intra-alveolar pressure, intrapleural pressure also changes during the different phases of breathing. However, due to

Physical Factors Affecting Ventilation
Inadditiontothedifferencesinpressures,breathingisalsodependentuponthecontractionandrelaxationofmusclefibers
of both the diaphragm and thorax. The lungs themselves are passive during breathing, meaning they are not involved in
creating the movement that helps inspiration and expiration. This is because of the adhesive nature of the pleural fluid,
which allows the lungs to be pulled outward when the thoracic wall moves during inspiration. The recoil of the thoracic
wall during expiration causes compression of the lungs. Contraction and relaxation of the diaphragm and intercostals
muscles(foundbetweentheribs)causemostofthepressurechangesthatresultininspirationandexpiration.Thesemuscle
movements and subsequent pressure changes cause air to either rush in or be forced out of the lungs.
Other characteristics ofthe lungs influence the effort that must be expended to ventilate. Resistance is a force that slows
motion, in this case, the flow of gases. The size of the airway is the primary factor affecting resistance. A small tubular
diameter forces air through a smaller space, causing more collisions of air molecules with the walls of the airways. The
following formula helps to describe the relationship between airway resistance and pressure changes:
F = ∆P/ R
Asnotedearlier,thereissurfacetensionwithinthealveolicausedbywaterpresentintheliningofthealveoli.Thissurface
tension tends to inhibit expansion of the alveoli. However, pulmonary surfactant secreted by type II alveolar cells mixes
with that water and helps reduce this surface tension. Without pulmonary surfactant, the alveoli would collapse during
expiration.

involved in stimulating the brain to produce pulmonary ventilation.
The major factor that stimulates the medulla oblongata and pons to produce respiration is surprisingly not oxygen
concentration, but rather the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. As you recall, carbon dioxide is a waste
1004 CHAPTER 22 | THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
product of cellular respiration and can be toxic. Concentrations of chemicals are sensed by chemoreceptors. A central
chemoreceptor is one of the specialized receptors that are located in the brain and brainstem, whereas a peripheral

centers of the brain. In the case of carbon dioxide, as the concentration of CO2 in the blood increases, it readily diffuses
acrosstheblood-brainbarrier,whereitcollectsintheextracellularfluid.Aswillbeexplainedinmoredetaillater,increased
carbon dioxide levels lead to increased levels of hydrogen ions, decreasing pH. The increase in hydrogen ions in the
brain triggers the central chemoreceptors to stimulate the respiratory centers to initiate contraction of the diaphragm and
intercostal muscles. As a result, the rate and depth of respiration increase, allowing more carbon dioxide to be expelled,

Gas Exchange
Gasexchangeoccursattwositesinthebody:inthelungs,whereoxygenispickedupandcarbondioxideisreleasedatthe
respiratory membrane, and at the tissues, where oxygen is released and carbon dioxide is picked up. External respiration
is the exchange of gases with the external environment, and occurs in the alveoli of the lungs. Internal respiration is the
exchange of gases with the internal environment, and occurs in the tissues. The actual exchange of gases occurs due to
simplediffusion.Energyisnotrequiredtomoveoxygenorcarbondioxideacrossmembranes.Instead,thesegasesfollow

Although the solubility of oxygen in blood is not high, there is a drastic difference in the partial pressure of oxygen in

A hyperbaric chamber is a unit that can be sealed and expose a patient to either 100 percent oxygen with increased
pressure or a mixture of gases that includes a higher concentration of oxygen than normal atmospheric air, also at
a higher partial pressure than the atmosphere. There are two major types of chambers: monoplace and multiplace.
Monoplace chambers are typically for one patient, and the staff tending to the patient observes the patient from
outside of the chamber (Figure 22.24). Some facilities have special monoplace hyperbaric chambers that allow
multiple patients to be treated at once, usually in a sitting or reclining position, to help ease feelings of isolation or
claustrophobia. Multiplace chambers are large enough for multiple patients to be treated at one time, and the staff
attendingthesepatientsispresentinsidethechamber.Inamultiplacechamber,patientsareoftentreatedwithairviaa

hemoglobin’s affinity for carbon monoxide is much stronger than its affinity for oxygen, causing carbon monoxide
to replace oxygen in the blood. Hyperbaric chamber therapy can treat carbon monoxide poisoning, because the
increased atmospheric pressure causes more oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream. At this increased pressure and

transported between the external and internal respiration sites. Although carbon dioxide is more soluble than oxygen in
blood, both gases require a specialized transport system for the majority of the gas molecules to be moved between the
lungs and other tissues.

moleculestotheerythrocyte(Figure22.25).Hemeistheportionofhemoglobinthatcontainsiron,anditishemethatbinds

moleculesofoxygen.Asoxygendiffusesacrosstherespiratorymembranefromthealveolustothecapillary,italsodiffuses
into the red blood cell and is boundbyhemoglobin. The following reversible chemical reaction describes the production
of the final product, oxyhemoglobin (Hb–O2), which is formed when oxygen binds to hemoglobin. Oxyhemoglobin is a
bright red-colored molecule that contributes to the bright red color of oxygenated blood.
Hb + O ↔Hb − O
2 2
In this formula, Hb represents reduced hemoglobin, that is, hemoglobin that does not have oxygen bound to it. There
are multiple factors involved in how readily heme binds to and dissociates from oxygen, which will be discussed in the
subsequent sections.
Figure 22.25 Erythrocyte and Hemoglobin Hemoglobin consists of four subunits, each of which contains one
molecule of iron.
1012 CHAPTER 22 | THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Function of Hemoglobin
Hemoglobin is composed of subunits, a protein structure that is referred to as a quaternary structure. Each of the four
subunits that make up hemoglobin is arranged in a ring-like fashion, with an iron atom covalently bound to the heme in
thecenterofeachsubunit.Bindingofthefirstoxygenmoleculecausesaconformationalchangeinhemoglobinthatallows

Partialpressureisanimportantaspectofthebindingofoxygentoanddisassociationfromheme.Anoxygen–hemoglobin
dissociation curve is a graph that describes the relationship of partial pressure to the binding of oxygen to heme and its
subsequent dissociation from heme (Figure 22.26). Remember that gases travel from an area of higher partial pressure
to an area of lower partial pressure. In addition, the affinity of an oxygen molecule for heme increases as more oxygen
molecules are bound. Therefore, in the oxygen–hemoglobin saturation curve, as the partial pressure of oxygen increases,
a proportionately greater number of oxygen molecules are bound by heme. Not surprisingly, the oxygen–hemoglobin

Certain hormones, such as androgens, epinephrine, thyroid hormones, and growth hormone, can affect the
oxygen–hemoglobin saturation/disassociation curve by stimulating the production of a compound called
2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) by erythrocytes. BPG is a byproduct of glycolysis. Because erythrocytes do not contain

The pH of the blood is another factor that influences the oxygen–hemoglobin saturation/dissociation curve (see Figure
22.26). The Bohr effect is a phenomenon that arises from the relationship between pH and oxygen’s affinity for
hemoglobin: A lower, more acidic pH promotes oxygen dissociation from hemoglobin. In contrast, a higher, or more
basic,pHinhibitsoxygendissociationfromhemoglobin.Thegreatertheamountofcarbondioxideintheblood,themore
molecules that must be converted, which in turn generates hydrogen ions and thus lowers blood pH. Furthermore, blood
pH may become more acidic when certain byproducts of cell metabolism, such as lactic acid, carbonic acid, and carbon
dioxide, are released into the bloodstream.
Hemoglobin of the Fetus
The fetus has its own circulation with its own erythrocytes; however,it is dependent onthe mother foroxygen. Blood is
suppliedtothefetusbywayoftheumbilicalcord,whichisconnectedtotheplacentaandseparatedfrommaternalblood
by the chorion. The mechanism of gas exchange at the chorion is similar to gas exchange at the respiratory membrane.

hemoglobin have a different structure that causes fetal hemoglobin to have a greater affinity for oxygen than does adult
hemoglobin.

Carbon Dioxide Transport in the Blood
Carbon dioxide is transported by three major mechanisms. The first mechanism of carbon dioxide transport is by blood
plasma, as some carbon dioxide molecules dissolve in the blood. The second mechanism is transport in the form of
bicarbonate (HCO3–), which also dissolves in plasma. The third mechanism of carbon dioxide transport is similar to the
transport of oxygen by erythrocytes (Figure 22.28).
Figure 22.28 Carbon Dioxide Transport Carbon dioxide is transported by three different methods: (a) in
erythrocytes; (b) after forming carbonic acid (H2CO3), which is dissolved in plasma; (c) and in plasma.

respiratory membrane into the alveoli, where it is then exhaled during pulmonary ventilation.
Bicarbonate Buffer
A large fraction—about 70 percent—of the carbon dioxide molecules that diffuse into the blood is transported to the
lungs as bicarbonate. Most bicarbonate is produced in erythrocytes after carbon dioxide diffuses into the capillaries, and
subsequently into red blood cells. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) causes carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid
(H2CO3), which dissociates into two ions: bicarbonate (HCO3–) and hydrogen (H+). The following formula depicts this
reaction:
CA

shift and occurs because by exchanging one negative ion for another negative ion, neither the electrical charge of the
erythrocytes nor that of the blood is altered.
At the pulmonary capillaries, the chemical reaction that produced bicarbonate (shown above) is reversed, and carbon
dioxide and water are the products. Much of the bicarbonate in the plasma re-enters the erythrocytes in exchange for
chlorideions.Hydrogenionsandbicarbonateionsjointoformcarbonicacid,whichisconvertedintocarbondioxideand
water by carbonic anhydrase. Carbon dioxide diffuses out of the erythrocytes and into the plasma, where it can further
diffuse across the respiratory membrane into the alveoli to be exhaled during pulmonary ventilation.
Carbaminohemoglobin
About20percentofcarbondioxideisboundbyhemoglobinandistransportedtothelungs.Carbondioxidedoesnotbind
to iron as oxygen does; instead, carbon dioxide binds amino acid moieties on the globin portions of hemoglobin to form
carbaminohemoglobin, which forms when hemoglobin and carbon dioxide bind. When hemoglobin is not transporting
oxygen, it tends to have a bluish-purple tone to it, creating the darker maroon color typical of deoxygenated blood. The
following formula depicts this reversible reaction:
CO + Hb↔HbCO
2 2
Similar to the transport of oxygen by heme, the binding and dissociation of carbon dioxide to and from hemoglobin is
dependentonthepartialpressureofcarbondioxide.Becausecarbondioxideisreleasedfromthelungs,bloodthatleaves

carbondioxideleavesthetissuesbecauseofitshigherpartialpressure,enterstheblood,andthenmovesintoredbloodcells,

to within the alveoli. As a result, carbon dioxide dissociates readily from hemoglobin and diffuses across the respiratory
membrane into the air.

oxygenmoleculesareboundbyhemoglobin.Despitethis,thetissuesofthebodystillreceiveasufficientamountofoxygen
during rest at high altitudes. This is due to two major mechanisms. First, the number of oxygen molecules that enter the
tissue from the blood is nearly equal between sea level and high altitudes. At sea level, hemoglobin saturation is higher,
butonlyaquarteroftheoxygenmolecules areactually releasedintothetissue.Athighaltitudes, agreaterproportionof
molecules of oxygen are released into the tissues. Secondly, at high altitudes, a greater amount of BPG is produced by
erythrocytes,whichenhancesthedissociationofoxygenfromhemoglobin.Physicalexertion,suchasskiingorhiking,can
lead to altitude sickness due to the low amount of oxygen reserves in the blood at high altitudes. At sea level, there is a

levels drop but not the total number of erythrocytes. In this way, the overall concentration of erythrocytes in the blood
increases, which helps tissues obtain the oxygen they need.
Acute mountain sickness (AMS), or altitude sickness, is a condition that results from acute exposure to high altitudes
due to a low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitudes. AMS typically can occur at 2400 meters (8000 feet) above sea
level. AMS is a result of low blood oxygen levels, as the body has acute difficulty adjusting to the low partial pressure
ofoxygen.Inseriouscases,AMScancausepulmonaryorcerebraledema.SymptomsofAMSincludenausea,vomiting,

oxygen at high altitudes results in a lower oxygen saturation level of hemoglobin in the blood. In turn, the tissue levels
of oxygen are also lower. As a result, the kidneys are stimulated to produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which

altitude over a long period. With more red blood cells, there is more hemoglobin to help transport the available oxygen.
Even though there is low saturation of each hemoglobin molecule, there will be more hemoglobin present, and therefore
more oxygen in the blood. Over time, this allows the person to partake in physical exertion without developing AMS.

CHAPTER 22 | THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 1019
Development of the respiratory system begins early in the fetus. It is a complex process that includes many structures,
most of which arise from the endoderm. Towards the end of development, the fetus can be observed making breathing
movements.Untilbirth,however,themotherprovidesalloftheoxygentothefetusaswellasremovesallofthefetalcarbon

developed until early childhood, when a full complement of mature alveoli is present.

Weeks 7–16
Bronchial buds continue to branch as development progresses until all of the segmental bronchi have been formed.
Beginning around week 13, the lumens of the bronchi begin to expand in diameter. By week 16, respiratory bronchioles
form. The fetus now has all major lung structures involved in the airway.
Weeks 16–24
Once the respiratory bronchioles form, further development includes extensive vascularization, or the development of
the blood vessels, as well as the formation of alveolar ducts and alveolar precursors. At about week 19, the respiratory
bronchioleshaveformed.Inaddition,cellsliningtherespiratorystructuresbegintodifferentiatetoformtypeIandtypeII

Fetal “Breathing”
Although the function of fetal breathing movements is not entirely clear, they can be observed starting at 20–21 weeks
of development. Fetal breathing movements involve muscle contractions that cause the inhalation of amniotic fluid and
exhalation of the same fluid, with pulmonary surfactant and mucus. Fetal breathing movements are not continuous
and may include periods of frequent movements and periods of no movements. Maternal factors can influence the
frequencyofbreathingmovements. Forexample, highbloodglucoselevels, called hyperglycemia, canboostthenumber
of breathing movements. Conversely, low blood glucose levels, called hypoglycemia, can reduce the number of fetal
breathingmovements.Tobaccouseisalsoknowntolowerfetalbreathingrates.Fetalbreathingmayhelptonethemusclesin

the surfaces for gas exchange have not formed adequately; therefore, survival is low.
Respiratory System: Respiratory Distress Syndrome
Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) primarily occurs ininfants bornprematurely.Upto50percent ofinfants born
between 26 and 28 weeks and fewer than 30 percent of infants born between 30 and 31 weeks develop RDS. RDS
results from insufficient production of pulmonary surfactant, thereby preventing the lungs from properly inflating
at birth. A small amount of pulmonary surfactant is produced beginning at around 20 weeks; however, this is not
sufficientforinflationofthelungs.Asaresult,dyspneaoccursandgasexchangecannotbeperformedproperly.Blood
oxygen levels are low, whereas blood carbon dioxide levels and pH are high.
TheprimarycauseofRDSisprematurebirth,whichmaybeduetoavarietyofknownorunknowncauses.Otherrisk
factors include gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery, second-born twins, and family history of RDS. The presence
of RDS can lead to other serious disorders, such as septicemia (infection of the blood) or pulmonary hemorrhage.
Therefore, it is important that RDS is immediately recognized and treated to prevent death and reduce the risk of
developing other disorders.
Medical advances have resulted in an improved ability to treat RDS and support the infant until proper lung
developmentcanoccur.Atthetimeofdelivery,treatmentmayincluderesuscitationandintubationiftheinfantdoes
notbreatheonhisorherown.Theseinfantswouldneedtobeplacedonaventilatortomechanicallyassistwiththe
breathingprocess.Ifspontaneousbreathingoccurs,applicationofnasalcontinuouspositiveairwaypressure(CPAP)
may be required. In addition, pulmonary surfactant is typically administered. Death due to RDS has been reduced
by 50 percent due to the introduction of pulmonary surfactant therapy. Other therapies may include corticosteroids,
supplemental oxygen, and assisted ventilation. Supportive therapies, such as temperature regulation, nutritional
support, and antibiotics, may be administered to the premature infant as well.

22.1Organs and Structures of the Respiratory System
The respiratory system is responsible for obtaining oxygen and getting rid of carbon dioxide, and aiding in speech
productionandinsensingodors.Fromafunctionalperspective,therespiratorysystemcanbedividedintotwomajorareas:
theconductingzoneandtherespiratoryzone.Theconductingzoneconsistsofallofthestructuresthatprovidepassageways
for air to travel into and out of the lungs: the nasal cavity, pharynx, trachea, bronchi, and most bronchioles. The nasal
passagescontaintheconchaeandmeatusesthatexpandthesurfaceareaofthecavity,whichhelpstowarmandhumidify
incoming air, while removing debris and pathogens. The pharynx is composed of three major sections: the nasopharynx,
which is continuous with the nasal cavity; the oropharynx, which borders the nasopharynx and the oral cavity; and the
laryngopharynx,whichborderstheoropharynx,trachea,andesophagus.Therespiratoryzoneincludesthestructuresofthe
lung that are directly involved in gas exchange: the terminal bronchioles and alveoli.
Theliningoftheconductingzoneiscomposedmostlyofpseudostratified ciliated columnarepithelium withgobletcells.
The mucus traps pathogens and debris, whereas beating cilia move the mucus superiorly toward the throat, where it is
swallowed. As the bronchioles become smaller and smaller, and nearer the alveoli, the epithelium thins and is simple
squamousepitheliuminthealveoli.Theendotheliumofthesurroundingcapillaries,togetherwiththealveolarepithelium,
forms the respiratory membrane. This is a blood-air barrier through which gas exchange occurs by simple diffusion.

22.3The Process of Breathing
Pulmonary ventilation is the process of breathing, which is driven by pressure differences between the lungs and the
atmosphere.Atmosphericpressureistheforceexertedbygasespresentintheatmosphere.Theforceexertedbygaseswithin
the alveoli is called intra-alveolar (intrapulmonary) pressure, whereas the force exerted by gases in the pleural cavity is
calledintrapleuralpressure.Typically,intrapleuralpressureislower,ornegativeto,intra-alveolarpressure.Thedifference
inpressurebetweenintrapleuralandintra-alveolarpressuresiscalledtranspulmonarypressure.Inaddition,intra-alveolar
pressurewillequalizewiththeatmosphericpressure.Pressureisdeterminedbythevolumeofthespaceoccupiedbyagas
andisinfluencedbyresistance.Airflowswhenapressuregradientiscreated,fromaspaceofhigherpressuretoaspaceof

volume because the gas molecules have more space to in which to move. The same quantity of gas in a smaller volume
results in gas molecules crowding together, producing increased pressure.
Resistance is created by inelastic surfaces, as well as the diameter of the airways. Resistance reduces the flow of gases.
Thesurfacetensionofthealveolialsoinfluencespressure,asitopposestheexpansionofthealveoli.However,pulmonary
surfactanthelpstoreducethesurfacetensionsothatthealveolidonotcollapseduringexpiration.Theabilityofthelungs
to stretch, called lung compliance, also plays a role in gas flow. The more the lungs can stretch, the greater the potential
volume of the lungs. The greater the volume of the lungs, the lower the air pressure within the lungs.
Pulmonary ventilation consists oftheprocessofinspiration (orinhalation), whereairenters thelungs,andexpiration (or

brain,andperipheralchemoreceptors,whicharelocatedintheaorticarchandcarotidarteries.Ariseincarbondioxideora
decline in oxygen levels in the blood stimulates an increase in respiratory rate and depth.
22.4Gas Exchange
ThebehaviorofgasescanbeexplainedbytheprinciplesofDalton’slawandHenry’slaw,bothofwhichdescribeaspectsof
gasexchange.Dalton’slawstatesthateachspecificgasinamixtureofgasesexertsforce(itspartialpressure)independently
oftheothergasesinthemixture.Henry’slawstatesthattheamountofaspecificgasthatdissolvesinaliquidisafunction
of its partial pressure. The greater the partial pressure of a gas, the more of that gas will dissolve in a liquid, as the gas
moves toward equilibrium. Gas molecules move down a pressure gradient; in other words, gas moves from a region of
high pressure to a region of low pressure. The partial pressure of oxygen is high in the alveoli and low in the blood of
thepulmonarycapillaries.Asaresult,oxygendiffusesacrosstherespiratorymembranefromthealveoliintotheblood.In
contrast,thepartialpressureofcarbondioxideishighinthepulmonarycapillariesandlowinthealveoli.Therefore,carbon
dioxidediffusesacrosstherespiratorymembranefromthebloodintothealveoli.Theamountofoxygenandcarbondioxide
that diffuses across the respiratory membrane is similar.

bicarbonate,formedinerythrocytes.Forthisconversion,carbondioxideiscombinedwithwaterwiththeaidofanenzyme
called carbonic anhydrase. This combination forms carbonic acid, which spontaneously dissociates into bicarbonate and
hydrogen ions. As bicarbonate builds up in erythrocytes, it is moved across the membrane into the plasma in exchange
forchlorideionsbyamechanismcalledthechlorideshift.Atthepulmonarycapillaries,bicarbonatere-enterserythrocytes

Carbon dioxide then diffuses out of the erythrocyte and across the respiratory membrane into the air. An intermediate
amount of carbon dioxide binds directly to hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin. The partial pressures of carbon
dioxide and oxygen, as well as the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, influence how readily hemoglobin binds carbon
dioxide. The less saturated hemoglobin is and the lower the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is, the more readily
hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide. This is an example of the Haldane effect.

22.6Modifications in Respiratory Functions
Normally, the respiratory centers of the brain maintain a consistent, rhythmic breathing cycle. However, in certain cases,
therespiratorysystemmustadjusttosituationalchangesinordertosupplythebodywithsufficientoxygen.Forexample,
exerciseresultsinincreasedventilation,andchronicexposuretoahighaltituderesultsinagreaternumberofcirculating
erythrocytes. Hyperpnea, an increase in the rate and depth of ventilation, appears to be a function of three neural
mechanisms that include a psychological stimulus, motor neuron activation of skeletal muscles, and the activation of
proprioceptors in the muscles, joints, and tendons. As a result, hyperpnea related to exercise is initiated when exercise
begins, as opposed to when tissue oxygen demand actually increases.
Incontrast,acuteexposuretoahighaltitude, particularly duringtimesofphysicalexertion,doesresultinlowbloodand
tissue levels of oxygen. This change is caused by a low partial pressure of oxygen in the air, because the atmospheric
pressure at high altitudes is lower than the atmospheric pressure at sea level. This can lead to a condition called acute
mountain sickness (AMS) with symptoms that include headaches, disorientation, fatigue, nausea, and lightheadedness.
Over a long period of time, a person’s body will adjust to the high altitude, a process called acclimatization. During
acclimatization, the low tissue levels of oxygen will cause the kidneys to produce greater amounts of the hormone
erythropoietin, which stimulates the production of erythrocytes. Increased levels of circulating erythrocytes provide an
increased amount of hemoglobin that helps supply an individual with more oxygen, preventing the symptoms of AMS.

Figure 23.2 Components of the Digestive System All digestive organs play integral roles in the life-sustaining
process of digestion.
As is the case with all body systems, the digestive system does not work in isolation; it functions cooperatively with the
other systems of the body. Consider for example, the interrelationship between the digestive and cardiovascular systems.

Arteries supply the digestive organs with oxygen and processed nutrients, and veins drain the digestive tract. These

Digestive System Organs
The easiest way to understand the digestive system is to divide its organs into two main categories. The first group is
the organs that make up the alimentary canal. Accessory digestive organs comprise the second group and are critical for
orchestratingthebreakdownoffoodandtheassimilationofitsnutrientsintothebody.Accessorydigestiveorgans,despite
their name, are critical to the function of the digestive system.
Alimentary Canal Organs
Alsocalledthegastrointestinal (GI)tractorgut,thealimentarycanal(aliment- =“tonourish”)isaone-waytubeabout
7.62meters(25feet)inlengthduringlifeandcloserto10.67meters(35feet)inlengthwhenmeasuredafterdeath,once

stomach, and small and large intestines to fit the functional needs of the body. Both the mouth and anus are open to the
externalenvironment;thus,foodandwasteswithinthealimentarycanalaretechnicallyconsideredtobeoutsidethebody.
Only through the process of absorption do the nutrients in food enter into and nourish the body’s “inner space.”

Together,these are called accessory organsbecause they sproutfromthe lining cells ofthe developing gut(mucosa) and
augmentitsfunction;indeed,youcouldnotlivewithouttheirvitalcontributions,andmanysignificantdiseasesresultfrom
their malfunction. Even after development is complete, they maintain a connection to the gut by way of ducts.
Histology of the Alimentary Canal
Throughout its length, the alimentary tract is composed of the same four tissue layers; the details of their structural
arrangementsvarytofittheirspecificfunctions.Startingfromthelumenandmovingoutwards,theselayersarethemucosa,
submucosa, muscularis, and serosa, which is continuous with the mesentery (seeFigure 23.3).
1034 CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
Figure 23.3 Layers of the Alimentary Canal The wall of the alimentary canal has four basic tissue layers: the
mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, and serosa.
Themucosaisreferredtoasamucousmembrane,becausemucusproductionisacharacteristicfeatureofgutepithelium.
The membrane consists of epithelium, which is in direct contact with ingested food, and the lamina propria, a layer of
connectivetissueanalogoustothedermis.Inaddition,themucosahasathin,smoothmusclelayer,calledthemuscularis
mucosa (not to be confused with the muscularis layer, described below).
Epithelium—In the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and anal canal, the epithelium is primarily a non-keratinized, stratified
squamous epithelium. In the stomach and intestines, it is a simple columnar epithelium. Notice that the epithelium is in
directcontactwiththelumen,thespaceinsidethealimentarycanal.Interspersedamongitsepithelialcellsaregobletcells,
whichsecretemucusandfluidintothelumen,andenteroendocrinecells,whichsecretehormonesintotheinterstitialspaces
between cells. Epithelial cells have averybrief lifespan, averaging fromonlyacouple ofdays (inthe mouth) toabout a
week(inthegut).Thisprocessofrapidrenewalhelpspreservethehealthofthealimentarycanal,despitethewearandtear

the immune system has evolved a means of defending against the pathogens encountered within it.
Muscularismucosa—Thisthinlayerofsmoothmuscleisinaconstantstateoftension,pullingthemucosaofthestomach
and small intestine into undulating folds. These folds dramatically increase the surface area available for digestion and
absorption.
As its name implies, the submucosa lies immediately beneath the mucosa. A broad layer of dense connective tissue, it
connects the overlying mucosa to the underlying muscularis. It includes blood and lymphatic vessels (which transport
absorbed nutrients), and a scattering of submucosal glands that release digestive secretions. Additionally, it serves as a
conduit for a dense branching network of nerves, the submucosal plexus, which functions as described below.

branches of cranial nerves.
Intrinsic innervation of much of the alimentary canal is provided by the enteric nervous system, which runs from the
esophagus to the anus, and contains approximately 100 million motor, sensory, and interneurons (unique to this system
compared to all other parts of the peripheral nervous system). These enteric neurons are grouped into two plexuses. The
myentericplexus(plexusofAuerbach)liesinthemuscularislayerofthealimentarycanalandisresponsibleformotility,
especiallytherhythmandforceofthecontractionsofthemuscularis.Thesubmucosalplexus(plexusofMeissner)liesin
thesubmucosallayerandisresponsibleforregulatingdigestivesecretionsandreactingtothepresenceoffood(seeFigure
23.3).
Extrinsic innervations of the alimentary canal are provided by the autonomic nervous system, which includes both
sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. In general, sympathetic activation (the fight-or-flight response) restricts the
activityofentericneurons,therebydecreasingGIsecretionandmotility.Incontrast,parasympatheticactivation(therest-
and-digest response) increases GI secretion and motility by stimulating neurons of the enteric nervous system.
Blood Supply

absorbed by mucosal cells after food is digested in the lumen. Lipids are absorbed via lacteals, tiny structures of the

aorta. The celiac trunk services the liver, stomach, and duodenum, whereas the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries

Digestive System: Peritonitis
Inflammation of the peritoneum is called peritonitis. Chemical peritonitis can develop any time the wall of the
alimentarycanalisbreached,allowingthecontentsofthelumenentryintotheperitonealcavity.Forexample,when
an ulcer perforates the stomach wall, gastric juices spill into the peritoneal cavity. Hemorrhagic peritonitis occurs

great grandparents and even your parents were young, the mortality from peritonitis was high. Aggressive surgery,
improvements in anesthesia safety, the advance of critical care expertise, and antibiotics have greatly improved the
mortality rate from this condition. Even so, the mortality rate still ranges from 30 to 40 percent.

23.2 | Digestive System Processes and Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Discuss six fundamental activities of the digestive system, giving an example of each
• Compare and contrast the neural and hormonal controls involved in digestion
The digestive system uses mechanical and chemical activities to break food down into absorbable substances during its
journey through the digestive system.Table 23.3provides an overview of the basic functions of the digestive organs.

Swallowingcanbedifficult,andingestedfoodmovesslowlythroughthealimentarycanalbecauseofreducedstrength

stimulate the release of enzymes and hormones.
Pathologies that affect the digestive organs—such as hiatal hernia, gastritis, and peptic ulcer disease—can occur
at greater frequencies as you age. Problems in the small intestine may include duodenal ulcers, maldigestion, and
malabsorption.Problemsinthelargeintestineincludehemorrhoids,diverticulardisease,andconstipation.Conditions
that affect the function of accessory organs—and their abilities to deliver pancreatic enzymes and bile to the small
intestine—include jaundice, acute pancreatitis, cirrhosis, and gallstones.
In some cases, a single organ is in charge of a digestive process. For example, ingestion occurs only in the mouth and

Regulatory Mechanisms
Neural and endocrine regulatory mechanisms work to maintain the optimal conditions in the lumen needed for digestion
andabsorption.Theseregulatorymechanisms,whichstimulatedigestiveactivitythroughmechanicalandchemicalactivity,
are controlled both extrinsically and intrinsically.
Neural Controls
The walls of the alimentary canal contain a variety of sensors that help regulate digestive functions. These include
mechanoreceptors,chemoreceptors,andosmoreceptors,whicharecapableofdetectingmechanical,chemical,andosmotic
stimuli,respectively.Forexample,thesereceptorscansensewhenthepresenceoffoodhascausedthestomachtoexpand,

othernerveplexuses—eitherwithinthesamedigestiveorganorindifferentones.Theseinteractionspromptseveraltypes
of reflexes. Extrinsic nerve plexuses orchestrate long reflexes, which involve the central and autonomic nervous systems
and work in response to stimuli from outside the digestive system. Short reflexes, on the other hand, are orchestrated
by intrinsic nerve plexuses within the alimentary canal wall. These two plexuses and their connections were introduced

reflexes that begin with a sensory neuron delivering a signal to the medulla oblongata. The response to the signal is to
stimulate cells in the stomach to begin secreting digestive juices in preparation for incoming food. In contrast, food that
distends the stomach initiates short reflexes that cause cells in the stomach wall to increase their secretion of digestive
juices.
Hormonal Controls
Avarietyofhormonesareinvolvedinthedigestiveprocess.Themaindigestivehormoneofthestomachisgastrin,which

23.3 | The Mouth, Pharynx, and Esophagus
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the structures of the mouth, including its three accessory digestive organs
• Group the 32 adult teeth according to name, location, and function
• Describe the process of swallowing, including the roles of the tongue, upper esophageal sphincter, and epiglottis
• Trace the pathway food follows from ingestion into the mouth through release into the stomach
Inthis section, youwill examine the anatomy and functions ofthe three main organs ofthe upper alimentary canal—the
mouth, pharynx, and esophagus—as well as three associated accessory organs—the tongue, salivary glands, and teeth.

The Tongue
Perhaps you have heard it said that the tongue is the strongest muscle in the body. Those who stake this claim cite its
strength proportionate to its size. Although it is difficult to quantify the relative strength of different muscles, it remains

is the enzyme salivary amylase, which initiates the breakdown of carbohydrates. Food does not spend enough time in
the mouth to allow all the carbohydrates to break down, but salivary amylase continues acting until it is inactivated by
stomachacids.Bicarbonateandphosphateionsfunctionaschemicalbuffers,maintainingsalivaatapHbetween6.35and

third of the esophagus, the muscularis is skeletal muscle. In the middle third, it is both skeletal and smooth muscle. In
the lower third, it is smooth muscle. As mentioned previously, the most superficial layer of the esophagus is called the
adventitia, not the serosa. In contrast to the stomach and intestines, the loose connective tissue of the adventitia is not
covered by a fold of visceral peritoneum. The digestive functions of the esophagus are identified inTable 23.5.

Deglutition
Deglutition is another word for swallowing—the movement of food from the mouth to the stomach. The entire process
takes about 4 to 8 seconds for solid or semisolid food, and about 1 second for very soft food and liquids. Although this
soundsquickandeffortless,deglutitionis,infact,acomplexprocessthatinvolvesboththeskeletalmuscleofthetongue

the mouth closed and prevent food from falling out. At this point, the two involuntary phases of swallowing begin.
The Pharyngeal Phase
Inthe pharyngeal phase, stimulation ofreceptors in the oropharynx sends impulses to the deglutition center (a collection
of neurons that controls swallowing) in the medulla oblongata. Impulses are then sent back to the uvula and soft palate,
causingthemtomoveupwardandcloseoffthenasopharynx.Thelaryngealmusclesalsoconstricttopreventaspirationof

Contractionsofthepharyngealconstrictormusclesmovethebolusthroughtheoropharynxandlaryngopharynx.Relaxation
of the upper esophageal sphincter then allows food to enter the esophagus.
The Esophageal Phase
The entry of food into the esophagus marks the beginning of the esophageal phase of deglutition and the initiation of
peristalsis.Asinthepreviousphase,thecomplexneuromuscularactionsarecontrolledbythemedullaoblongata.Peristalsis
propels the bolus through the esophagus and toward the stomach. The circular muscle layer of the muscularis contracts,
pinching the esophageal wall and forcing the bolus forward. At the same time, the longitudinal muscle layer of the
muscularis also contracts, shortening this area and pushing out its walls to receive the bolus. In this way, a series of
contractionskeepsmovingfoodtowardthestomach.Whenthebolusnearsthestomach,distentionoftheesophagusinitiates
a short reflex relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter that allows the bolus to pass into the stomach. During the
esophageal phase, esophageal glands secrete mucus that lubricates the bolus and minimizes friction.

23.4 | The Stomach
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Label on a diagram the four main regions of the stomach, its curvatures, and its sphincter
• Identify the four main types of secreting cells in gastric glands, and their important products
• Explain why the stomach does not digest itself
• Describe the mechanical and chemical digestion of food entering the stomach
Although a minimal amount of carbohydrate digestion occurs in the mouth, chemical digestion really gets underway in
the stomach. An expansion of the alimentary canal that lies immediately inferior to the esophagus, the stomach links the
esophagus to the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum) and is relatively fixed in place at its esophageal and
duodenalends.Inbetween,however,itcanbeahighlyactivestructure,contractingandcontinuallychangingpositionand

but can stretch to hold as much as 4 liters of food and fluid, or more than 75 times its empty volume, and then return to
its resting size when empty. Although you might think that the size of a person’s stomach is related to how much food
that individual consumes, body weight does not correlate with stomach size. Rather, when you eat greater quantities of
food—such as at holiday dinner—you stretch the stomach more than when you eat less.

CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 1055
Figure 23.17 The Three Phases of Gastric Secretion Gastric secretion occurs in three phases: cephalic, gastric,
and intestinal. During each phase, the secretion of gastric juice can be stimulated or inhibited.

however,becausewhentheintestinedistendswithchyme,theenterogastricreflexinhibitssecretion.Oneoftheeffectsof
this reflex is to close the pyloric sphincter, which blocks additional chyme from entering the duodenum.
The Mucosal Barrier
The mucosa of the stomach is exposed to the highly corrosive acidity of gastric juice. Gastric enzymes that can digest
proteincanalsodigestthestomachitself.Thestomachisprotectedfromself-digestionbythemucosalbarrier.Thisbarrier
hasseveralcomponents.First,thestomachwalliscoveredbyathickcoatingofbicarbonate-richmucus.Thismucusforms

surface epithelium of the stomach is completely replaced every 3 to 6 days.
Ulcers: When the Mucosal Barrier Breaks Down
As effective as the mucosal barrier is, it is not a “fail-safe” mechanism. Sometimes, gastric juice eats away at the
superficialliningofthestomachmucosa,creatingerosions,whichmostlyhealontheirown.Deeperandlargererosions
are called ulcers.
Whydoesthemucosalbarrierbreakdown?Anumberoffactorscaninterferewithitsabilitytoprotectthestomach
lining. The majority of all ulcers are caused by either excessive intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), including aspirin, orHelicobacter pyloriinfection.
Antacidshelprelievesymptomsofulcerssuchas“burning”painandindigestion.WhenulcersarecausedbyNSAID
use, switching to other classes of pain relievers allows healing. When caused by H. pylori infection, antibiotics are
effective.
A potential complication of ulcers is perforation: Perforated ulcers create a hole in the stomach wall, resulting in
peritonitis (inflammation of the peritoneum). These ulcers must be repaired surgically.
Digestive Functions of the Stomach
The stomach participates in virtually all the digestive activities with the exception of ingestion and defecation. Although
almostallabsorptiontakesplaceinthesmallintestine,thestomachdoesabsorbsomenonpolarsubstances,suchasalcohol
and aspirin.
Mechanical Digestion

seconds.Amixingwaveisauniquetypeofperistalsisthatmixesandsoftensthefoodwithgastricjuicestocreatechyme.
The initial mixing waves are relatively gentle, but these are followed by more intense waves, starting at the body of the
stomach and increasing in force as they reach the pylorus. It is fair to say that long before your sushi exits through the
pyloric sphincter, it bears little resemblance to the sushi you ate.
Thepylorus,whichholdsaround30mL(1fluidounce)ofchyme,actsasafilter,permittingonlyliquidsandsmallfood
particlestopassthroughthemostly,butnotfully,closedpyloricsphincter.Inaprocesscalledgastricemptying,rhythmic
mixing waves force about 3 mL of chyme at a time through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum. Release of a
greateramountofchymeatonetimewouldoverwhelmthecapacityofthesmallintestinetohandleit.Therestofthechyme
is pushed back into the body of the stomach, where it continues mixing. This process is repeated when the next mixing
waves force more chyme into the duodenum.
Gastricemptyingisregulatedbyboththestomachandtheduodenum.Thepresenceofchymeintheduodenumactivates
receptors that inhibit gastric secretion. This prevents additional chyme from being released by the stomach before the
duodenum is ready to process it.
Chemical Digestion

and activates lingual lipase. Lingual lipase then begins breaking down triglycerides into free fatty acids, and mono- and
diglycerides.
ThebreakdownofproteinbeginsinthestomachthroughtheactionsofHClandtheenzymepepsin.Duringinfancy,gastric
glands also produce rennin, an enzyme that helps digest milk protein.
Its numerous digestive functions notwithstanding, there is only one stomach function necessary to life: the production of
intrinsic factor. The intestinal absorption of vitamin B12, which is necessary for both the production of mature red blood
cells and normal neurological functioning, cannot occur without intrinsic factor. People who undergo total gastrectomy
(stomachremoval)—forlife-threateningstomachcancer,forexample—cansurvivewithminimaldigestivedysfunctionif
they receive vitamin B12injections.
Thecontentsofthestomacharecompletelyemptiedintotheduodenumwithin2to4hoursafteryoueatameal.Different
types of food take different amounts of time to process. Foods heavy in carbohydrates empty fastest, followed by high-
proteinfoods.Mealswithahightriglyceridecontentremaininthestomachthelongest.Sinceenzymesinthesmallintestine
digest fats slowly, food can stay in the stomach for 6 hours or longer when the duodenum is processing fatty chyme.
However, note that this is still a fraction of the 24 to 72 hours that full digestion typically takes from start to finish.
23.5 | The Small and Large Intestines
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Compare and contrast the location and gross anatomy of the small and large intestines
• Identify three main adaptations of the small intestine wall that increase its absorptive capacity
• Describe the mechanical and chemical digestion of chyme upon its release into the small intestine
• List three features unique to the wall of the large intestine and identify their contributions to its function
• Identify the beneficial roles of the bacterial flora in digestive system functioning
• Trace the pathway of food waste from its point of entry into the large intestine through its exit from the body as
feces
The word intestine is derived from a Latin root meaning “internal,” and indeed, the two organs together nearly fill the
interioroftheabdominalcavity.Inaddition,calledthesmallandlargebowel,orcolloquiallythe“guts,”theyconstitutethe

Microvilli
As their name suggests, microvilli (singular = microvillus) are much smaller (1 µm) than villi. They are cylindrical
apical surface extensions of the plasma membrane of the mucosa’s epithelial cells, and are supported by microfilaments
within those cells. Although their small size makes it difficult to see each microvillus, their combined microscopic
appearancesuggestsamassofbristles,whichistermedthebrushborder.Fixedtothesurfaceofthemicrovillimembranes
are enzymes that finish digesting carbohydrates and proteins. There are an estimated 200 million microvilli per square
millimeter of small intestine, greatly expanding the surface area of the plasma membrane and thus greatly enhancing
absorption.
Intestinal Glands
In addition to the three specialized absorptive features just discussed, the mucosa between the villi is dotted with deep

The submucosa of the duodenum is the only site of the complex mucus-secreting duodenal glands (Brunner’s glands),
which produce a bicarbonate-rich alkaline mucus that buffers the acidic chyme as it enters from the stomach.

Whenmostofthechymehasbeenabsorbed,thesmallintestinalwallbecomeslessdistended.Atthispoint,thelocalized

Small Intestine: Lactose Intolerance

able to maintain the ability to produce lactase as adults.
In people with lactose intolerance, the lactose in chyme is not digested. Bacteria in the large intestine ferment the

Bacterial Flora
Most bacteria that enter the alimentary canal are killed by lysozyme, defensins, HCl, or protein-digesting enzymes.
However, trillions of bacteria live within the large intestine and are referred to as the bacterial flora. Most of the more
than 700 species of these bacteria are nonpathogenic commensal organisms that cause no harm as long as they stay in
the gut lumen. In fact, many facilitate chemical digestion and absorption, and some synthesize certain vitamins, mainly
biotin,pantothenicacid,andvitaminK.Somearelinkedtoincreasedimmuneresponse.Arefinedsystempreventsthese

by the ileocecal sphincter. Right after you eat, peristalsis in the ileum forces chyme into the cecum. When the cecum is

distendedwithchyme,contractionsoftheileocecalsphincterstrengthen.Oncechymeentersthececum,colonmovements
begin.
Mechanical digestion in the large intestine includes a combination of three types of movements. The presence of food
residues in the colon stimulates a slow-moving haustral contraction. This type of movement involves sluggish
segmentation, primarily in the transverse and descending colons. When a haustrum is distended with chyme, its muscle
contracts, pushing the residue into the next haustrum. These contractions occur about every 30 minutes, and each last
about1minute.Thesemovementsalsomixthefoodresidue,whichhelpsthelargeintestineabsorbwater.Thesecondtype
of movement is peristalsis, which, in the large intestine, is slower than in the more proximal portions of the alimentary
canal. The third type is a mass movement. These strong waves start midway through the transverse colon and quickly

Chemical Digestion
Although the glands of the large intestine secrete mucus, they do not secrete digestive enzymes. Therefore, chemical
digestion in the large intestine occurs exclusively because of bacteria in the lumen of the colon. Through the process of
saccharolytic fermentation, bacteria break down some of the remaining carbohydrates. This results in the discharge of
hydrogen,carbondioxide,andmethanegasesthatcreateflatus(gas)inthecolon;flatulenceisexcessiveflatus.Eachday,

otherwise indigestible sugars and complex carbohydrates like soluble dietary fiber.
Absorption, Feces Formation, and Defecation
The small intestine absorbs about 90 percent of the water you ingest (either as liquid or within solid food). The large
intestine absorbs most of the remaining water, a process that converts the liquid chyme residue into semisolid feces
(“stool”). Feces is composed of undigested food residues, unabsorbed digested substances, millions of bacteria, old

mL (17 ounces) of food residue that enters the cecum each day, about 150 mL (5 ounces) become feces.
Feces are eliminated through contractions of the rectal muscles. You help this process by a voluntary procedure called
Valsalva’smaneuver,inwhichyouincreaseintra-abdominalpressurebycontractingyourdiaphragmandabdominalwall

Figure 23.24 Accessory Organs The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are considered accessory digestive organs,
but their roles in the digestive system are vital.
The Liver
The liver is the largest gland in the body, weighing about three pounds in an adult. It is also one of the most important
organs. In addition to being an accessory digestive organ, it plays a number of roles in metabolism and regulation. The
liver lies inferior to the diaphragm in the right upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity and receives protection from the
surrounding ribs.
1068 CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
The liver is divided into two primary lobes: a large right lobe and a much smaller left lobe. In the right lobe, some
anatomistsalsoidentifyaninferiorquadratelobeandaposteriorcaudatelobe,whicharedefinedbyinternalfeatures.The
liver is connected to the abdominal wall and diaphragm by five peritoneal folds referred to as ligaments. These are the
falciformligament,thecoronaryligament,twolateralligaments,andtheligamentumtereshepatis.Thefalciformligament
and ligamentum teres hepatis are actually remnants ofthe umbilical vein, and separate the right and left lobes anteriorly.
The lesser omentum tethers the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach.
The porta hepatis (“gate to the liver”) is where the hepatic artery and hepatic portal vein enter the liver. These two
vessels, along with the common hepatic duct, run behind the lateral border of the lesser omentum on the way to their
destinations. As shown in Figure 23.25, the hepatic artery delivers oxygenated blood from the heart to the liver. The

Hepatocytes work non-stop, but bile production increases when fatty chyme enters the duodenum and stimulates the
secretion of the gut hormone secretin. Between meals, bile is produced but conserved. The valve-like hepatopancreatic
ampulla closes, allowing bile to divert to the gallbladder, where it is concentrated and stored until the next meal.

Pancreatic Juice
The pancreas produces over a liter of pancreatic juice each day. Unlike bile, it is clear and composed mostly of water

the stomach, and create an optimal environment for the activity of pH-sensitive digestive enzymes in the small intestine.
Pancreatic enzymes are active in the digestion of sugars, proteins, and fats.
The pancreas produces protein-digesting enzymes in their inactive forms. These enzymes are activated in the duodenum.
If produced in an active form, they would digest the pancreas (which is exactly what occurs in the disease, pancreatitis).
Theintestinalbrushborderenzymeenteropeptidasestimulatestheactivationoftrypsinfromtrypsinogenofthepancreas,
which in turn changes the pancreatic enzymes procarboxypeptidase and chymotrypsinogen into their active forms,

they do not attack the pancreas as do the protein-digesting enzymes.

CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 1071
Pancreatic Secretion
Regulation of pancreatic secretion is the job of hormones and the parasympathetic nervous system. The entry of acidic
chyme into the duodenum stimulates the release of secretin, which in turn causes the duct cells to release bicarbonate-
rich pancreatic juice. The presence of proteins and fats in the duodenum stimulates the secretion of CCK, which then
stimulatestheacinitosecreteenzyme-richpancreaticjuiceandenhancestheactivityofsecretin.Parasympatheticregulation

Usually, the pancreas secretes just enough bicarbonate to counterbalance the amount of HCl produced in the stomach.
Hydrogen ions enter the blood when bicarbonate is secreted by the pancreas. Thus, the acidic blood draining from the

Carbohydrate Digestion
The average American diet is about 50 percent carbohydrates, which may be classified according to the number of
monomers they contain of simple sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) and/or complex sugars (polysaccharides).

helps propel food through the alimentary canal.
The chemical digestion of starches begins in the mouth and has been reviewed above.
In the small intestine, pancreatic amylase does the ‘heavy lifting’ for starch and carbohydrate digestion (Figure 23.29).
After amylases break down starch into smaller fragments, the brush border enzyme α-dextrinase starts working on α-

Protein Digestion
Proteins are polymers composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds to form long chains. Digestion reduces them to
their constituent amino acids. You usually consume about 15 to 20 percent of your total calorie intake as protein.
Thedigestionofproteinstartsinthestomach,whereHClandpepsinbreakproteinsintosmallerpolypeptides,whichthen
traveltothesmallintestine(Figure23.30).Chemicaldigestioninthesmallintestineiscontinuedbypancreaticenzymes,
including chymotrypsin andtrypsin, each ofwhich act onspecific bondsinamino acid sequences. Atthe same time, the
cells of the brush border secrete enzymes such as aminopeptidase and dipeptidase, which further break down peptide
chains. This results in molecules small enough to enter the bloodstream (Figure 23.31).

Figure 23.31 Digestion of Protein Flow Chart Proteins are successively broken down into their amino acid
components.
Lipid Digestion
A healthy diet limits lipid intake to 35 percent of total calorie intake. The most common dietary lipids are triglycerides,
which are made up of a glycerol molecule bound to three fatty acid chains. Small amounts of dietary cholesterol and
phospholipids are also consumed.
Thethreelipasesresponsibleforlipiddigestionarelinguallipase,gastriclipase,andpancreaticlipase.However,because

(less than 10 to 12 carbons) and long-chain fatty acids.
Nucleic Acid Digestion
The nucleic acids DNA and RNA are found in most of the foods you eat. Two types of pancreatic nuclease are
responsible for their digestion: deoxyribonuclease, which digests DNA, and ribonuclease, which digests RNA. The

CHAPTER 23 | THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 1077
Absorption
The mechanical and digestive processes have one goal: to convert food into molecules small enough to be absorbed by
the epithelial cells of the intestinal villi. The absorptive capacity of the alimentary canal is almost endless. Each day, the
alimentarycanalprocessesupto10litersoffood,liquids,andGIsecretions,yetlessthanoneliterentersthelargeintestine.
Almostallingestedfood,80percentofelectrolytes,and90percentofwaterareabsorbedinthesmallintestine.Although
theentiresmallintestineisinvolvedintheabsorptionofwaterandlipids,mostabsorptionofcarbohydratesandproteins
occurs in the jejunum. Notably, bile salts and vitamin B12 are absorbed in the terminal ileum. By the time chyme passes

water, and millions of bacteria (Figure 23.32).
Figure23.32DigestiveSecretionsandAbsorptionofWater Absorptionisacomplexprocess,inwhichnutrients
from digested food are harvested.
Absorptioncanoccurthroughfivemechanisms:(1)activetransport,(2)passivediffusion,(3)facilitateddiffusion,(4)co-
transport (or secondary active transport), and (5) endocytosis. As you will recall from Chapter 3, active transport refers
to the movement of a substance across a cell membrane going from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher
concentration(uptheconcentrationgradient).Inthistypeoftransport,proteinswithinthecellmembraneactas“pumps,”
using cellular energy (ATP) to move the substance. Passive diffusion refers to the movement of substances from an area
ofhigherconcentrationtoanareaoflowerconcentration,whilefacilitateddiffusionreferstothemovementofsubstances
from an area of higher to an area of lower concentration using a carrier protein in the cell membrane. Co-transport uses
the movement of one molecule through the membrane from higher to lower concentration to power the movement of
anotherfromlowertohigher.Finally,endocytosisisatransportationprocessinwhichthecellmembraneengulfsmaterial.

Carbohydrate Absorption
All carbohydrates are absorbed in the form of monosaccharides. The small intestine is highly efficient at this, absorbing
monosaccharides at an estimated rate of 120 grams per hour. All normally digested dietary carbohydrates are absorbed;
indigestible fibers are eliminated in the feces. The monosaccharides glucose and galactose are transported into the
epithelial cells by common protein carriers via secondary active transport (that is, co-transport with sodium ions). The
monosaccharides leave these cells via facilitated diffusion and enter the capillaries through intercellular clefts. The
monosaccharidefructose(whichisinfruit)isabsorbedandtransportedbyfacilitateddiffusionalone.Themonosaccharides
combine with the transport proteins immediately after the disaccharides are broken down.

epithelial cells, they are broken down into their amino acids before leaving the cell and entering the capillary blood via
diffusion.

lipids would sit on the surface of chyme and never come in contact with the absorptive surfaces of the epithelial cells.
Micelles can easily squeeze between microvilli and get very near the luminal cell surface. At this point, lipid substances
exit the micelle and are absorbed via simple diffusion.
The free fatty acids and monoacylglycerides that enter the epithelial cells are reincorporated into triglycerides. The

Ingeneral,allmineralsthatentertheintestineareabsorbed,whetheryouneedthemornot.Ironandcalciumareexceptions;
they are absorbed in the duodenum in amounts that meet the body’s current requirements, as follows:
Iron—The ionic iron needed for the production of hemoglobin is absorbed into mucosal cells via active transport. Once
inside mucosal cells, ionic iron binds to the protein ferritin, creating iron-ferritin complexes that store iron until needed.
When the body has enough iron, most of the stored iron is lost when worn-out epithelial cells slough off. When the
body needs iron because, for example, it is lost during acute or chronic bleeding, there is increased uptake of iron from
the intestine and accelerated release of iron into the bloodstream. Since women experience significant iron loss during
menstruation, they have around four times as many iron transport proteins in their intestinal epithelial cells as do men.
Calcium—Bloodlevelsofioniccalciumdeterminetheabsorptionofdietarycalcium.Whenbloodlevelsofioniccalcium

CHAPTER REVIEW
23.1Overview of the Digestive System
The digestive system includes the organs of the alimentary canal and accessory structures. The alimentary canal forms a
continuous tube that is open to the outside environment at both ends. The organs of the alimentary canal are the mouth,
pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The accessory digestive structures include the teeth,
tongue,salivaryglands,liver,pancreas,andgallbladder.Thewallofthealimentarycanaliscomposedoffourbasictissue
layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, and serosa. The enteric nervous system provides intrinsic innervation, and the
autonomic nervous system provides extrinsic innervation.
23.2Digestive System Processes and Regulation
The digestive system ingests and digests food, absorbs released nutrients, and excretes food components that are
indigestible. The six activities involved in this process are ingestion, motility, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion,
absorption, and defecation. These processes are regulated by neural and hormonal mechanisms.
23.3The Mouth, Pharynx, and Esophagus
In the mouth, the tongue and the teeth begin mechanical digestion, and saliva begins chemical digestion. The pharynx,
which plays roles in breathing and vocalization as well as digestion, runs from the nasal and oral cavities superiorly to
theesophagusinferiorly(fordigestion)andtothelarynxanteriorly(forrespiration).Duringdeglutition(swallowing),the

Hormonal Regulation of Metabolism
Catabolic and anabolic hormones in the body help regulate metabolic processes. Catabolic hormones stimulate the
breakdown of molecules and the production of energy. These include cortisol, glucagon, adrenaline/epinephrine, and
cytokines. All of these hormones are mobilized at specific times to meet the needs of the body. Anabolic hormones are

Metabolic Processes: Cushing Syndrome and Addison’s Disease
As might be expected for a fundamental physiological process like metabolism, errors or malfunctions in metabolic
processing lead to a pathophysiology or—if uncorrected—a disease state. Metabolic diseases are most commonly
the result of malfunctioning proteins or enzymes that are critical to one or more metabolic pathways. Protein or
enzyme malfunction can be the consequence of a genetic alteration or mutation. However, normally functioning
proteinsandenzymescanalsohavedeleteriouseffectsiftheiravailabilityisnotappropriatelymatchedwithmetabolic
need. For example, excessive production of the hormone cortisol (see Table 24.1) gives rise to Cushing syndrome.
Clinically,Cushingsyndromeischaracterizedbyrapidweightgain,especiallyinthetrunkandfaceregion,depression,
and anxiety. It is worth mentioning that tumors of the pituitary that produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH),
which subsequently stimulates the adrenal cortex to release excessive cortisol, produce similar effects. This indirect
mechanism of cortisol overproduction is referred to as Cushing disease.
Patients with Cushing syndrome can exhibit high blood glucose levels and are at an increased risk of becoming
obese. They also show slow growth, accumulation of fat between the shoulders, weak muscles, bone pain (because
cortisolcausesproteinstobebrokendowntomakeglucoseviagluconeogenesis),andfatigue.Othersymptomsinclude

(hyperkalemia).Victimsalsomaysufferfromlossofappetite,chronicdiarrhea,vomiting,mouthlesions,andpatchy

involves cortisol replacement therapy, which usually must be continued for life.

24.2 | Carbohydrate Metabolism
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the processes of glycolysis
• Describe the pathway of a pyruvate molecule through the Krebs cycle
• Explain the transport of electrons through the electron transport chain
• Describe the process of ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation
• Summarize the process of gluconeogenesis
Carbohydrates are organic molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. The family of carbohydrates
includes both simple and complex sugars. Glucose and fructose are examples of simple sugars, and starch, glycogen,
and cellulose are all examples of complex sugars. The complex sugars are also called polysaccharides and are made of
multiplemonosaccharidemolecules.Polysaccharidesserveasenergystorage(e.g.,starchandglycogen)andasstructural

insulin and, through a series of reactions called glycolysis, transfer some of the energy in glucose to ADP to form ATP
(Figure 24.5). The last step in glycolysis produces the productpyruvate.
Glycolysisbeginswiththephosphorylationofglucosebyhexokinasetoformglucose-6-phosphate.ThisstepusesoneATP,
which is the donor of the phosphate group. Under the action of phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate is converted
into fructose-6-phosphate. At this point, a second ATP donates its phosphate group, forming fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
This six-carbon sugar is split to form two phosphorylated three-carbon molecules, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and
dihydroxyacetonephosphate,whicharebothconvertedintoglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.Theglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
is further phosphorylated with groups donated by dihydrogen phosphate present in the cell to form the three-carbon

Figure 24.5 Glycolysis Overview During the energy-consuming phase of glycolysis, two ATPs are consumed,
transferring two phosphates to the glucose molecule. The glucose molecule then splits into two three-carbon
compounds, each containing a phosphate. During the second phase, an additional phosphate is added to each of
the three-carbon compounds. The energy for this endergonic reaction is provided by the removal (oxidation) of two
electrons from each three-carbon compound. During the energy-releasing phase, the phosphates are removed from
both three-carbon compounds and used to produce four ATP molecules.

However, the end of the reaction produces four ATPs, resulting in a net gain of two ATP energy molecules.
Glycolysis can be expressed as the following equation:
Glucose + 2ATP + 2NAD+ + 4ADP + 2Pi → 2 Pyruvate + 4ATP + 2NADH + 2H+
This equation states that glucose, in combination with ATP (the energy source), NAD+ (a coenzyme that serves as an

Anaerobic Respiration
When oxygen is limited or absent, pyruvate enters an anaerobic pathway. In these reactions, pyruvate can be converted
into lactic acid. In addition to generating an additional ATP, this pathway serves to keep the pyruvate concentration low
soglycolysiscontinues,anditoxidizesNADHintotheNAD+neededbyglycolysis.Inthisreaction, lactic acidreplaces
oxygen as the final electron acceptor. Anaerobic respiration occurs in most cells of the body when oxygen is limited or

Krebs Cycle/Citric Acid Cycle/Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle
The pyruvate molecules generated during glycolysis are transported across the mitochondrial membrane into the inner
mitochondrial matrix, where they are metabolized by enzymes in a pathway called the Krebs cycle (Figure 24.7). The

The six-carbon citrate molecule is systematically converted to a five-carbon molecule and then a four-carbon molecule,
ending with oxaloacetate, the beginning of the cycle. Along the way, each citrate molecule will produce one ATP, one
FADH2, and three NADH. The FADH2 and NADH will enter the oxidative phosphorylation system located in the inner
mitochondrial membrane. In addition, the Krebs cycle supplies the starting materials to process and break down proteins

Gluconeogenesis
Gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of new glucose molecules from pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, or the amino acids alanine
or glutamine. This process takes place primarily in the liver during periods of low glucose, that is, under conditions of
fasting,starvation,andlowcarbohydratediets.So,thequestioncanberaisedastowhythebodywouldcreatesomething

to normal.
Gluconeogenesis is not simply the reverse of glycolysis. There are some important differences (Figure 24.10). Pyruvate
is a common starting material for gluconeogenesis. First, the pyruvate is converted into oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate
then serves as a substrate for the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), which transforms oxaloacetate
into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). From this step, gluconeogenesis is nearly the reverse of glycolysis. PEP is converted
back into 2-phosphoglycerate, which is converted into 3-phosphoglycerate. Then, 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into
1,3 bisphosphoglycerate and then into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Two molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate then
combine to form fructose-1-6-bisphosphate, which is converted into fructose 6-phosphate and then into
glucose-6-phosphate.Finally,aseriesofreactionsgeneratesglucoseitself.Ingluconeogenesis(ascomparedtoglycolysis),
the enzyme hexokinase is replaced by glucose-6-phosphatase, and the enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 is replaced by
fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. This helps the cell to regulate glycolysis and gluconeogenesis independently of each other.
As will be discussed as part of lipolysis, fats can be broken down into glycerol, which can be phosphorylated to form
dihydroxyacetonephosphateorDHAP.DHAPcaneitherentertheglycolyticpathwayorbeusedbytheliverasasubstrate

also travels to the brain, where it can act as a hunger suppressant.
Together, the pancreatic lipases and bile salts break down triglycerides into free fatty acids. These fatty acids can be
transported across the intestinal membrane. However, once they cross the membrane, they are recombined to again form
triglyceride molecules. Within the intestinal cells, these triglycerides are packaged along with cholesterol molecules in
phospholipidvesicles called chylomicrons(Figure24.12).Thechylomicrons enablefatsandcholesterol tomovewithin
the aqueous environment of your lymphatic and circulatory systems. Chylomicrons leave the enterocytes by exocytosis
and enter the lymphatic system via lacteals in the villi of the intestine. From the lymphatic system, the chylomicrons
are transported to the circulatory system. Once in the circulation, they can either go to the liver or be stored in fat cells
(adipocytes) that comprise adipose (fat) tissue found throughout the body.

Lipogenesis
When glucose levels are plentiful, the excess acetyl CoA generated by glycolysis can be converted into fatty acids,
triglycerides,cholesterol,steroids,andbilesalts.Thisprocess,calledlipogenesis,createslipids(fat)fromtheacetylCoA
and takes place in the cytoplasm of adipocytes (fat cells) and hepatocytes (liver cells). When you eat more glucose or
carbohydrates than your body needs, your system uses acetyl CoA to turn the excess into fat. Although there are several
metabolic sources of acetyl CoA, it is most commonly derived from glycolysis. Acetyl CoA availability is significant,
becauseitinitiateslipogenesis.LipogenesisbeginswithacetylCoAandadvancesbythesubsequentadditionoftwocarbon

the energy available in carbohydrates. Triglycerides and lipids, high-energy molecules, are stored in adipose tissue until
they are needed.
Although lipogenesis occurs in the cytoplasm, the necessary acetyl CoA is created in the mitochondria and cannot be
transported across the mitochondrial membrane. To solve this problem, pyruvate is converted into both oxaloacetate and
acetyl CoA. Two different enzymes are required for these conversions. Oxaloacetate forms via the action of pyruvate

Freely available amino acids are used to create proteins. If amino acids exist in excess, the body has no capacity or
mechanism for their storage; thus, they are converted into glucose or ketones, or they are decomposed. Amino acid

The earlier a modified diet is begun, the less severe the symptoms will be. The person must closely follow a strict
diet that is low in phenylalanine to avoid symptoms and damage. Phenylalanine is found in high concentrations in
artificial sweeteners, including aspartame. Therefore, these sweeteners must be avoided. Some animal products and
certain starches are also high in phenylalanine, and intake of these foods should be carefully monitored.

24.6 | Energy and Heat Balance
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe how the body regulates temperature
• Explain the significance of the metabolic rate
The body tightly regulates the body temperature through a process called thermoregulation, in which the body can
maintain its temperature within certain boundaries, even when the surrounding temperature is very different. The core
temperature of the body remains steady at around 36.5–37.5 °C (or 97.7–99.5 °F). In the process of ATP production by
cellsthroughoutthebody,approximately 60percentoftheenergyproducedisintheformofheatusedtomaintain body
temperature. Thermoregulation is an example of negative feedback.
The hypothalamus in the brain is the master switch that works as a thermostat to regulate the body’s core temperature
(Figure 24.23). If the temperature is too high, the hypothalamus can initiate several processes to lower it. These include
increasingthecirculationofthebloodtothesurfaceofthebodytoallowforthedissipationofheatthroughtheskinand
initiation of sweating to allow evaporation of water on the skin to cool its surface. Conversely, if the temperature falls
belowthesetcoretemperature,thehypothalamuscaninitiateshiveringtogenerateheat.Thebodyusesmoreenergyand
generatesmoreheat.Inaddition,thyroidhormonewillstimulatemoreenergyuseandheatproductionbycellsthroughout
the body. An environment is said to be thermoneutral when the body does not expend or release energy to maintain its
core temperature. For a naked human, this is an ambient air temperature of around 84 °F. If the temperature is higher,
for example, when wearing clothes, the body compensates with cooling mechanisms. The body loses heat through the
mechanisms of heat exchange.

1126 CHAPTER 24 | METABOLISM AND NUTRITION
Mechanisms of Heat Exchange
When the environment is not thermoneutral, the body uses four mechanisms of heat exchange to maintain homeostasis:
conduction,convection,radiation,andevaporation.Eachofthesemechanismsreliesonthepropertyofheattoflowfroma

Convectionisthetransferofheattotheairsurroundingtheskin.Thewarmedairrisesawayfromthebodyandisreplaced
by cooler air that is subsequently heated. Convection can also occur in water. When the water temperature is lower than
the body’s temperature, the body loses heat by warming the water closest to the skin, which moves away to be replaced
by cooler water. The convection currents created by the temperature changes continue to draw heat away from the body
morequickly thanthebodycanreplace it,resulting inhyperthermia. About15percent ofthebody’sheat islostthrough
convection.

However, the rate at which evaporation occurs depends on relative humidity—more sweat evaporates in lower humidity
environments.Sweatingistheprimarymeansofcoolingthebodyduringexercise,whereasatrest,about20percentofthe
heat lost by the body occurs through evaporation.
Metabolic Rate
The metabolic rate is the amount of energy consumed minus the amount of energy expended by the body. The basal
metabolic rate (BMR) describes the amount of daily energy expended by humans at rest, in a neutrally temperate
environment, while in the postabsorptive state. It measures how much energy the body needs for normal, basic, daily
activity. About 70 percent of all daily energy expenditure comes from the basic functions of the organs in the body.

24.7 | Nutrition and Diet
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain how different foods can affect metabolism
• Describe a healthy diet, as recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
• List reasons why vitamins and minerals are critical to a healthy diet
The carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in the foods you eat are used for energy to power molecular, cellular, and organ
system activities. Importantly, the energy is stored primarily as fats. The quantity and quality of food that is ingested,
digested,andabsorbedaffectstheamountoffatthatisstoredasexcesscalories.Diet—bothwhatyoueatandhowmuch
you eat—has a dramatic impact on your health. Eating too much or too little food can lead to serious medical issues,
includingcardiovasculardisease,cancer,anorexia,anddiabetes,amongothers.Combineanunhealthydietwithunhealthy
environmental conditions, such as smoking, and the potential medical complications increase significantly.

nutritional Calorie.
On average, a person needs 1500 to 2000 calories per day to sustain (or carry out) daily activities. The total number of
calories needed by one person is dependent on their body mass, age, height, gender, activity level, and the amount of
exercise per day. If exercise is regular part of one’s day, more calories are required. As a rule, people underestimate the

mile burns almost 100 calories.
The type of food ingested also affects the body’s metabolic rate. Processing of carbohydrates requires less energy than
processingofproteins.Infact,thebreakdownofcarbohydratesrequirestheleastamountofenergy,whereastheprocessing
of proteins demands the most energy. In general, the amount of calories ingested and the amount of calories burned
determines the overall weight. To lose weight, the number of calories burned per day must exceed the number ingested.
Calories are in almost everything you ingest, so when considering calorie intake, beverages must also be considered.
Tohelpprovideguidelinesregardingthetypesandquantitiesoffoodthatshouldbeeateneveryday,theUSDAhasupdated
their food guidelines from MyPyramid to MyPlate. They have put the recommended elements of a healthy meal into the
context of a place setting of food. MyPlate categorizes food into the standard six food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains,
proteinfoods,dairy,andoils.Theaccompanyingwebsitegivesclearrecommendationsregardingquantityandtypeofeach
food that you should consume each day, as well as identifying which foods belong in each category. The accompanying
graphic(Figure24.24)givesaclearvisualwithgeneralrecommendationsforahealthyandbalancedmeal.Theguidelines
recommend to “Make half your plate fruits and vegetables.” The other half is grains and protein, with a slightly higher
quantity of grains than protein. Dairy products are represented by a drink, but the quantity can be applied to other dairy
products as well.

Metabolism and Obesity
Obesity in the United States is epidemic. The rate of obesity has been steadily rising since the 1980s. In the 1990s,
moststatesreportedthatlessthan10percentoftheirpopulationswasobese,andthestatewiththehighestratereported

of obesity are concentrated in the southern states. They also find the level of childhood obesity is rising.
Obesityisdefinedbythebodymassindex(BMI),whichisameasureofanindividual’sweight-to-heightratio.The
normal,orhealthy,BMIrangeisbetween 18and24.9kg/m2.Overweight isdefinedasaBMIof25to29.9kg/m2,
andobesityisconsidered tobeaBMIgreater than30kg/m2.Obesitycanarisefromanumberoffactors,including

You get most of your vitamins through your diet, although some can be formed from the precursors absorbed during
digestion. For example, the body synthesizes vitamin A from the β-carotene in orange vegetables like carrots and sweet
potatoes. Vitamins are either fat-soluble or water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, are absorbed through the

CHAPTER REVIEW
24.1Overview of Metabolic Reactions
Metabolism is the sum of all catabolic (break down) and anabolic (synthesis) reactions in the body. The metabolic rate
measurestheamountofenergyusedtomaintainlife.Anorganismmustingestasufficientamountoffoodtomaintainits
metabolic rate if the organism is to stay alive for very long.
Catabolic reactions break down larger molecules, such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins from ingested food, into
their constituent smaller parts. They also include the breakdown of ATP, which releases the energy needed for metabolic
processes in all cells throughout the body.
Anabolicreactions,orbiosyntheticreactions,synthesizelargermoleculesfromsmallerconstituentparts,usingATPasthe
energysource forthese reactions. Anabolic reactions build bone,muscle mass, andnew proteins, fats, andnucleic acids.
Oxidation-reduction reactions transfer electrons across molecules by oxidizing one molecule and reducing another, and
collectingthereleasedenergytoconvertPiandADPintoATP.Errorsinmetabolismaltertheprocessingofcarbohydrates,
lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and can result in a number of disease states.

theoxidativephosphorylationprocessthatgeneratesmorehigh-energyATPmolecules.Foreachmoleculeofglucosethat
is processed in glycolysis, a net of 36 ATPs can be created by aerobic respiration.
Under anaerobic conditions, ATP production is limited to those generated by glycolysis. While a total of four ATPs are
produced by glycolysis, two are needed to begin glycolysis, so there is a net yield of two ATP molecules.
Inconditionsoflowglucose,suchasfasting,starvation,orlowcarbohydratediets,glucosecanbesynthesizedfromlactate,
pyruvate, glycerol, alanine, or glutamate. This process, called gluconeogenesis, is almost the reverse of glycolysis and
serves to create glucose molecules for glucose-dependent organs, such as the brain, when glucose levels fall below normal.
24.3Lipid Metabolism
Lipids are available to the body from three sources. They can be ingested in the diet, stored in the adipose tissue of the
body,orsynthesizedintheliver.Fatsingestedinthedietaredigestedinthesmallintestine.Thetriglyceridesarebroken

24.5Metabolic States of the Body
There are three main metabolic states of the body: absorptive (fed), postabsorptive (fasting), and starvation. During any
givenday,yourmetabolismswitchesbetweenabsorptiveandpostabsorptivestates.Starvationstateshappenveryrarelyin
generally well-nourished individuals. When the body is fed, glucose, fats, and proteins are absorbed across the intestinal
membraneandenterthebloodstreamandlymphaticsystemtobeusedimmediatelyforfuel.Anyexcessisstoredforlater
fastingstages.Asbloodglucoselevelsrise,thepancreasreleasesinsulintostimulatetheuptakeofglucosebyhepatocytes
intheliver,musclecells/fibers,andadipocytes(fatcells),andtopromoteitsconversiontoglycogen.Asthepostabsorptive
state begins, glucose levels drop, and there is a corresponding drop in insulin levels. Falling glucose levels trigger the
pancreas to release glucagon to turn off glycogen synthesis in the liver and stimulate its breakdown into glucose. The
glucose is released into the bloodstream to serve as a fuel source for cells throughout the body. If glycogen stores are
depletedduringfasting,alternativesources,includingfattyacidsandproteins,canbemetabolizedandusedasfuel.When
the body once again enters the absorptive state after fasting, fats and proteins are digested and used to replenish fat
and protein stores, whereas glucose is processed and used first to replenish the glycogen stores in the peripheral tissues,
then in the liver. If the fast is not broken and starvation begins to set in, during the initial days, glucose produced from
gluconeogenesisisstillusedbythebrainandorgans.Afterafewdays,however,ketonebodiesarecreatedfromfatsand

1146 CHAPTER 25 | THE URINARY SYSTEM
Figure25.3FemaleandMaleUrethras Theurethratransportsurinefromthebladdertotheoutsideofthebody.This
image shows (a) a female urethra and (b) a male urethra.
The urethra in both males and females begins inferior and central to the two ureteral openings forming the three points
of a triangular-shaped area at the base of the bladder called the trigone (Greek tri- = “triangle” and the root of the word
“trigonometry”). The urethra tracks posterior and inferior to the pubic symphysis (see Figure 25.3a). In both males and
females,theproximalurethraislinedbytransitionalepithelium,whereastheterminalportionisanonkeratinized,stratified
squamous epithelium. In the male, pseudostratified columnar epithelium lines the urethra between these two cell types.
Voiding is regulated by an involuntary autonomic nervous system-controlled internal urinary sphincter, consisting of
smooth muscle and voluntary skeletal muscle that forms theexternal urinary sphincterbelow it.

Male Urethra
The male urethra passes through the prostate gland immediately inferior to the bladder before passing below the pubic
symphysis (see Figure 25.3b). The length of the male urethra varies between men but averages 20 cm in length. It is
dividedintofourregions:thepreprostaticurethra,theprostaticurethra,themembranousurethra,andthespongyorpenile

Bladder
The urinary bladder collects urine from both ureters (Figure 25.4). The bladder lies anterior to the uterus in females,
posterior tothepubicboneandanterior totherectum. Duringlate pregnancy,itscapacity isreduced duetocompression
by the enlarging uterus, resulting in increased frequency of urination. In males, the anatomy is similar, minus the uterus,
andwiththeadditionoftheprostateinferiortothebladder.Thebladderispartiallyretroperitoneal(outsidetheperitoneal
cavity) with its peritoneal-covered “dome” projecting into the abdomen when the bladder is distended with urine.

the name) to a squamous appearance (seeFigure 25.4). Volumes in adults can range from nearly zero to 500–600 mL.
The detrusor muscle contracts with significant force in the young. The bladder’s strength diminishes with age, but
voluntary contractions of abdominal skeletal muscles can increase intra-abdominal pressure to promote more forceful
bladder emptying. Such voluntary contraction is also used in forceful defecation and childbirth.
Micturition Reflex
Micturition is a less-often used, but proper term for urination or voiding. It results from an interplay of involuntary and
voluntary actions by the internal and external urethral sphincters. When bladder volume reaches about 150 mL, an urge

or quadriplegia. However, relaxation of the external sphincter may not be possible in all cases, and therefore, periodic
catheterization may be necessary for bladder emptying.
Nerves involved in the control of urination include the hypogastric, pelvic, and pudendal (Figure 25.5). Voluntary
micturition requires an intact spinal cord and functional pudendal nerve arising from the sacral micturition center.

Nephrons and Vessels
The renal artery first divides into segmental arteries, followed by further branching to form interlobar arteries that pass
through the renal columns to reach the cortex (Figure 25.9). The interlobar arteries, in turn, branch into arcuate arteries,
corticalradiatearteries,andthenintoafferentarterioles.Theafferentarteriolesserviceabout1.3millionnephronsineach

The afferent arterioles form a tuft of high-pressure capillaries about 200 µm in diameter, the glomerulus. The rest of
the nephron consists of a continuous sophisticated tubule whose proximal end surrounds the glomerulus in an intimate
embrace—this is Bowman’s capsule. The glomerulus and Bowman’s capsule together form the renal corpuscle. As
mentioned earlier, these glomerular capillaries filter the blood based on particle size. After passing through the renal
corpuscle, the capillaries form a second arteriole, the efferent arteriole (Figure 25.10). These will next form a capillary

in turn forms a second capillary bed, the definition of a portal system is met. This is the only portal system in which an
arteriole is found between the first and second capillary beds. (Portal systems also link the hypothalamus to the anterior
pituitary, and the blood vessels of the digestive viscera to the liver.)

Cortex
In a dissected kidney, it is easy to identify the cortex; it appears lighter in color compared to the rest of the kidney.
All of the renal corpuscles as well as both the proximal convoluted tubules (PCTs) and distal convoluted tubules are

the podocyte “fingers,” the only thing separating the capillary lumen and the lumen of Bowman’s capsule is their shared
basement membrane (Figure 25.12). These three features comprise what is known as the filtration membrane. This
membrane permits very rapid movement of filtrate from capillary to capsule though pores that are only 70 nm in diameter.

The fenestrations prevent filtration of blood cells or large proteins, but allow most other constituents through. These
substances cross readily if they are less than 4 nm in size and most pass freely up to 8 nm in size. An additional factor
affectingtheabilityofsubstancestocrossthisbarrieristheirelectriccharge.Theproteinsassociatedwiththeseporesare
negatively charged, so they tend to repel negatively charged substances and allow positively charged substances to pass

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic forces that favor and oppose filtration
• Describeglomerularfiltration rate(GFR),statetheaveragevalueofGFR,andexplainhowclearance ratecanbe
used to measure GFR
• Predict specific factors that will increase or decrease GFR
• State the percent of the filtrate that is normally reabsorbed and explain why the process of reabsorption is so
important
• Calculate daily urine production
• List common symptoms of kidney failure
Having reviewed the anatomy and microanatomy ofthe urinary system, nowis the time to focus onthe physiology.You
will discover that different parts of the nephron utilize specific processes to produce urine: filtration, reabsorption, and
secretion.Youwilllearnhoweachoftheseprocessesworksandwheretheyoccuralongthenephronandcollectingducts.

Net Filtration Pressure (NFP)
NFP determines filtration rates through the kidney. It is determined as follows:
NFP = Glomerular blood hydrostatic pressure (GBHP) – [capsular hydrostatic pressure (CHP) + blood colloid osmotic
pressure (BCOP)] = 10 mm Hg
That is:
NFP = GBHP – [CHP + BCOP] = 10 mm Hg
Or:
NFP = 55 – [15 + 30] = 10 mm Hg

Determination of the GFR is one of the tools used to assess the kidney’s excretory function. This is more than just an

Additionally, administration of appropriate drug dosages for those drugs primarily excreted by the kidney requires an
accurate assessment of GFR. GFR can be estimated closely by intravenous administration of inulin. Inulin is a plant
polysaccharide that is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the kidney. Its appearance in the urine is directly proportional
totherateatwhichitisfilteredbytherenalcorpuscle.However,sincemeasuringinulinclearance iscumbersomeinthe

to review them.
Active transport utilizes energy, usually the energy found in a phosphate bond of ATP, to move a substance across a
membrane from a low to a high concentration. It is very specific and must have an appropriately shaped receptor forthe
substancetobetransported.AnexamplewouldbetheactivetransportofNa+outofacellandK+intoacellbytheNa+/K+

electrochemical gradient. On the opposite (apical) surface, a Na+/glucose symport protein channel assists both Na+ and

concentrations.Othersubstances,suchasurea,K+,ammonia(NH3),creatinine,andsomedrugsaresecretedintothefiltrate
as waste products. Acid–base balance is maintained through actions of the lungs and kidneys: The lungs rid the body
of H+, whereas the kidneys secrete or reabsorb H+ and HCO3– (Table 25.6). In the case of urea, about 50 percent is

Reabsorption and Secretion in the PCT
The renal corpuscle filters the blood to create a filtrate that differs from blood mainly in the absence of cells and large
proteins.Fromthispointtotheendsofthecollectingducts,thefiltrateorformingurineisundergoingmodificationthrough
secretion and reabsorption before true urine is produced. The first point at which the forming urine is modified is in the
PCT. Here, some substances are reabsorbed, whereas others are secreted. Note the use of the term “reabsorbed.” All of
these substances were “absorbed” in the digestive tract—99 percent of the water and most of the solutes filtered by the
nephron must be reabsorbed. Water and substances that are reabsorbed are returned to the circulation by the peritubular
andvasarectacapillaries.Itisimportanttounderstandthedifferencebetweentheglomerulusandtheperitubularandvasa
recta capillaries. The glomerulus has a relatively high pressure inside its capillaries and can sustain this by dilating the
afferent arteriole while constricting the efferent arteriole. This assures adequate filtration pressure even as the systemic
blood pressure varies. Movement of water into the peritubular capillaries and vasa recta will be influenced primarily by
osmolarityandconcentrationgradients.SodiumisactivelypumpedoutofthePCTintotheinterstitialspacesbetweencells
and diffuses down its concentration gradient into the peritubular capillary. As it does so, water will follow passively to
maintainanisotonicfluidenvironmentinsidethecapillary.Thisiscalledobligatorywaterreabsorption,becausewateris
“obliged” to follow the Na+(Figure 25.18).

As discussed above, the ascending loop has many Na+ pumps that actively pump Na+ out of the forming urine into the

Reabsorption and Secretion in the Distal Convoluted Tubule
Approximately 80 percent of filtered water has been recovered by the time the dilute forming urine enters the DCT. The
DCT will recover another 10–15 percent before the forming urine enters the collecting ducts. Aldosterone increases the
amountofNa+/K+ATPaseinthebasalmembraneoftheDCTandcollectingduct.ThemovementofNa+outofthelumen
of the collecting duct creates a negative charge that promotes the movement of Cl–out of the lumen into the interstitial
spacebyaparacellularrouteacrosstightjunctions.Peritubularcapillariesreceivethesolutesandwater,returningthemto
the circulation.
Cells of the DCT also recover Ca++ from the filtrate. Receptors for parathyroid hormone (PTH) are found in DCT cells
and when bound to PTH, induce the insertion of calcium channels on their luminal surface. The channels enhance Ca++
recoveryfromtheformingurine.Inaddition,asNa+ispumpedoutofthecell,theresultingelectrochemicalgradientattracts
Ca++intothecell.Finally,calcitriol(1,25dihydroxyvitaminD,theactiveformofvitaminD)isveryimportantforcalcium
recovery. It induces the production of calcium-binding proteins that transport Ca++ into the cell. These binding proteins
are also important for the movement of calcium inside the cell and aid in exocytosis of calcium across the basolateral
membrane. Any Ca++not reabsorbed at this point is lost in the urine.
Collecting Ducts and Recovery of Water
Solutes move across the membranes of the collecting ducts, which contain two distinct cell types, principal cells and

Regulation of urine volume and osmolarity are major functions of the collecting ducts. By varying the amount of water

rises,morewaterisrecoveredandurinevolumedecreases;ifplasmaosmolaritydecreases,lesswaterisrecoveredandurine
volumeincreases.ThisfunctionisregulatedbytheposteriorpituitaryhormoneADH(vasopressin).Withmilddehydration,
plasma osmolarity rises slightly. This increase is detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which stimulates the
release of ADH from the posterior pituitary. If plasma osmolarity decreases slightly, the opposite occurs.
1170 CHAPTER 25 | THE URINARY SYSTEM
When stimulated by ADH, aquaporin channels are inserted into the apical membrane of principal cells, which line
the collecting ducts. As the ducts descend through the medulla, the osmolarity surrounding them increases (due to the
countercurrent mechanisms described above). If aquaporin water channels are present, water will be osmotically pulled
fromthecollectingductintothesurroundinginterstitialspaceandintotheperitubularcapillaries.Therefore,thefinalurine
will be more concentrated. If less ADH is secreted, fewer aquaporin channels are inserted and less water is recovered,
resulting in dilute urine. By altering the number of aquaporin channels, the volume of water recovered or lost is altered.
This, in turn, regulates the blood osmolarity, blood pressure, and osmolarity of the urine.

In addition to receptors for ADH, principal cells have receptors for the steroid hormone aldosterone. While ADH is

It is vital that the flow of blood through the kidney be at a suitable rate to allow for filtration. This rate determines how
muchsoluteisretainedordiscarded,howmuchwaterisretainedordiscarded,andultimately,theosmolarityofbloodand
the blood pressure of the body.
Sympathetic Nerves
The kidneys are innervated by the sympathetic neurons of the autonomic nervous system via the celiac plexus and
splanchnic nerves. Reduction of sympathetic stimulation results in vasodilation and increased blood flow through the
kidneysduringrestingconditions.Whenthefrequencyofactionpotentialsincreases,thearteriolarsmoothmuscleconstricts
(vasoconstriction),resultingindiminishedglomerularflow,solessfiltrationoccurs.Underconditionsofstress,sympathetic
nervous activity increases, resulting in the direct vasoconstriction of afferent arterioles (norepinephrine effect) as well
as stimulation of the adrenal medulla. The adrenal medulla, in turn, produces a generalized vasoconstriction through the
release of epinephrine. This includes vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles, further reducing the volume of blood
flowing through the kidneys. This process redirects blood to other organs with more immediate needs. If blood pressure
falls,thesympatheticnerveswillalsostimulatethereleaseofrenin.Additionalreninincreasesproductionofthepowerful
vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, as discussed above, will also stimulate aldosterone production to augment
blood volume through retention of more Na+ and water. Only a 10 mm Hg pressure differential across the glomerulus is
required for normal GFR, so very small changes in afferent arterial pressure significantly increase or decrease GFR.

Severalhormoneshavespecific,importantrolesinregulatingkidneyfunction.Theyacttostimulateorinhibitbloodflow.
Some of these are endocrine, acting from a distance, whereas others are paracrine, acting locally.
Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone
Renin is an enzyme that is produced by the granular cells of the afferent arteriole at the JGA. It enzymatically converts
angiotensinogen(madebytheliver,freelycirculating)intoangiotensinI.ItsreleaseisstimulatedbyprostaglandinsandNO
from the JGA in response to decreased extracellular fluid volume.
1172 CHAPTER 25 | THE URINARY SYSTEM
ACE is not a hormone but it is functionally important in regulating systemic blood pressure and kidney function. It is
producedinthelungsbutbindstothesurfacesofendothelialcellsintheafferentarteriolesandglomerulus.Itenzymatically
converts inactive angiotensin I into active angiotensin II. ACE is important in raising blood pressure. People with high
blood pressure are sometimes prescribed ACE inhibitors to lower their blood pressure.
Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that plays an immediate role in the regulation of blood pressure. It acts
systemicallytocausevasoconstrictionaswellasconstrictionofboththeafferentandefferentarteriolesoftheglomerulus.In
instancesofbloodlossordehydration,itreducesbothGFRandrenalbloodflow,therebylimitingfluidlossandpreserving
bloodvolume.Itsrelease isusuallystimulated bydecreases inbloodpressure,andsothepreservation ofadequate blood
pressure is its primary role.
Aldosterone, often called the “salt-retaining hormone,” is released from the adrenal cortex in response to angiotensin II
or directly in response to increased plasma K+. It promotes Na+ reabsorption by the nephron, promoting the retention of
water.ItisalsoimportantinregulatingK+,promotingitsexcretion.(Thisdualeffectontwomineralsanditsorigininthe

Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)
Diuretics are drugs that can increase water loss by interfering with the recapture of solutes and water from the forming
urine.Theyareoftenprescribedtolowerbloodpressure.Coffee,tea,andalcoholicbeveragesarefamiliardiuretics.ADH,

Endothelin
Endothelins,21-aminoacidpeptides,areextremelypowerfulvasoconstrictors.Theyareproducedbyendothelialcellsof
therenalbloodvessels,mesangialcells,andcellsoftheDCT.Hormonesstimulatingendothelinreleaseincludeangiotensin

peoplewithdiabetickidneydisease,endothelinischronicallyelevated,resultinginsodiumretention.Theyalsodiminish
GFR by damaging the podocytes and by potently vasoconstricting both the afferent and efferent arterioles.
Natriuretic Hormones
Natriuretic hormones are peptides that stimulate the kidneys to excrete sodium—an effect opposite that of aldosterone.
NatriuretichormonesactbyinhibitingaldosteronereleaseandthereforeinhibitingNa+recoveryinthecollectingducts.If
Na+remainsintheformingurine,itsosmoticforcewillcauseaconcurrentlossofwater.Natriuretichormonesalsoinhibit
ADHrelease,whichofcoursewillresultinlesswaterrecovery.Therefore,natriureticpeptidesinhibitbothNa+andwater
recovery.Oneexamplefromthisfamilyofhormonesisatrialnatriuretichormone(ANH),a28-aminoacidpeptideproduced
by heart atria in response to over-stretching of the atrial wall. The over-stretching occurs in persons with elevated blood
pressureorheartfailure.ItincreasesGFRthroughconcurrentvasodilationoftheafferentarterioleandvasoconstrictionof
the efferent arteriole. These events lead to an increased loss of water and sodium in the forming urine. It also decreases
sodiumreabsorptionintheDCT.ThereisalsoB-typenatriureticpeptide(BNP)of32aminoacidsproducedintheventricles
of the heart. It has a 10-fold lower affinity for its receptor, so its effects are less than those of ANH. Its role may be to
provide“finetuning”fortheregulationofbloodpressure.BNP’slongerbiologichalf-lifemakesitagooddiagnosticmarker
of congestive heart failure (Figure 25.21).
Parathyroid Hormone
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an 84-amino acid peptide produced by the parathyroid glands in response to decreased
circulating Ca++ levels. Among its targets is the PCT, where it stimulates the hydroxylation of calcidiol to calcitriol
(1,25-hydroxycholecalciferol, the active form of vitamin D). It also blocks reabsorption of phosphate (PO3–), causing its
loss in the urine. The retention of phosphate would result in the formation of calcium phosphate in the plasma, reducing
circulating Ca++levels. By ridding the blood of phosphate, higher circulating Ca++levels are permitted.

The major hormones influencing total body water are ADH, aldosterone, and ANH. Circumstances that lead to fluid
depletioninthebodyincludebloodlossanddehydration.Homeostasisrequiresthatvolumeandosmolaritybepreserved.
Blood volume is important in maintaining sufficient blood pressure, and there are nonrenal mechanisms involved in its
preservation, including vasoconstriction, which can act within seconds of a drop in pressure. Thirst mechanisms are also

Volume-sensing Mechanisms
Thebodycannotdirectlymeasurebloodvolume,butbloodpressurecanbemeasured.Bloodpressureoftenreflectsblood
volume and is measured by baroreceptors in the aorta and carotid sinuses. When blood pressure increases, baroreceptors
send more frequent action potentials to the central nervous system, leading to widespread vasodilation. Included in this

asactivatedangiotensinIIproducesvasoconstriction.Theriseinpressureissustainedbythealdosteroneeffectsinitiated
by angiotensin II; this includes an increase in Na+ retention and water volume. As an aside, late in the menstrual cycle,
progesteronehasamodestinfluenceonwaterretention.Duetoitsstructuralsimilaritytoaldosterone,progesteronebinds
tothe aldosterone receptor inthe collecting duct ofthe kidney,causing the same, albeit weaker,effect onNa+andwater

Cardiomyocytesoftheatriaalsorespondtogreaterstretch(asbloodpressurerises)bysecretingANH.ANHopposesthe
action of aldosterone by inhibiting the recovery of Na+ by the DCT and collecting ducts. More Na+ is lost, and as water
follows, total blood volume and pressure decline. In low-pressure states, ANH does not seem to have much effect.
ADH is also called vasopressin. Early researchers found that in cases of unusually high secretion of ADH, the hormone
caused vasoconstriction (vasopressor activity, hence the name). Only later were its antidiuretic properties identified.
Synthetic ADH is still used occasionally to stem life-threatening esophagus bleeding in alcoholics.
Whenbloodvolumedrops5–10percent,causingadecreaseinbloodpressure,thereisarapidandsignificantincreasein
ADH release from the posterior pituitary. Immediate vasoconstriction to increase blood pressure is the result. ADH also
causes activation of aquaporin channels in the collecting ducts to affect the recovery of water to help restore vascular
volume.
Diuretics and Fluid Volume
Adiureticisacompoundthatincreasesurinevolume.Threefamiliardrinkscontaindiureticcompounds:coffee,tea,and
alcohol. The caffeine in coffee and tea works by promoting vasodilation in the nephron, which increases GFR. Alcohol

Themostfrequentlyprescribedanti-hypertensivediureticishydrochlorothiazide.ItinhibitstheNa+/Cl–symporterinthe
DCT and collecting duct. The result is a loss of Na+with water following passively by osmosis.
Osmotic diuretics promote water loss by osmosis. An example is the indigestible sugar mannitol, which is most often

casesofpoorlycontrolleddiabetesmellitus,glucoselevelsexceedthecapacityofthetubularglucosesymporters,resulting

glucosecouldbedetectedinthebloodandurine,cliniciansidentifieddiabetesmellitusbythethreePs:polyuria(diuresis),
polydipsia (increased thirst), and polyphagia (increased hunger).

Regulation of Extracellular Na
Sodium has a very strong osmotic effect and attracts water. It plays a larger role in the osmolarity of the plasma than
any other circulating component of the blood. If there is too much Na+ present, either due to poor control or excess
dietary consumption, a series of metabolic problems ensue. There is an increase in total volume of water, which leads to
hypertension(highbloodpressure).Overalongperiod,thisincreasestheriskofseriouscomplicationssuchasheartattacks,
strokes, and aneurysms. It can also contribute to system-wide edema (swelling).
Mechanisms for regulating Na+ concentration include the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and ADH (see Figure
25.14). Aldosterone stimulates the uptake of Na+ on the apical cell membrane of cells in the DCT and collecting ducts,
whereas ADH helps to regulate Na+concentration indirectly by regulating the reabsorption of water.

CHAPTER REVIEW
1182 CHAPTER 25 | THE URINARY SYSTEM
25.1Physical Characteristics of Urine
The kidney glomerulus filters blood mainly based on particle size to produce a filtrate lacking cells or large proteins.
Most of the ions and molecules in the filtrate are needed by the body and must be reabsorbed farther down the nephron
tubules,resultingintheformationofurine.Urinecharacteristicschangedependingonwaterintake,exercise,environmental
temperature, and nutrient intake. Urinalysis analyzes characteristics of the urine and is used to diagnose diseases. A
minimum of 400 to 500 mL urine must be produced daily to rid the body of wastes. Excessive quantities of urine may
indicate diabetes insipidus or diabetes mellitus. The pH range of urine is 4.5 to 8.0, and is affected by diet. Osmolarity
ranges from 50 to 1200 milliosmoles, and is a reflection of the amount of water being recovered or lost by renal nephrons.

retroperitoneal and can hold up to 500–600 mL urine. Micturition is the process of voiding the urine and involves both
involuntary and voluntary actions. Voluntary control of micturition requires a mature and intact sacral micturition center.

25.5Physiology of Urine Formation
Theentirevolumeofthebloodisfilteredthroughthekidneysabout300timesperday,and99percentofthewaterfiltered
is recovered. The GFR is influenced by hydrostatic pressure and colloid osmotic pressure. Under normal circumstances,
hydrostatic pressure is significantly greater and filtration occurs. The hydrostatic pressure of the glomerulus depends on
systemic blood pressure, autoregulatory mechanisms, sympathetic nervous activity, and paracrine hormones. The kidney
can function normally under a wide range of blood pressures due to the autoregulatory nature of smooth muscle.

CHAPTER 25 | THE URINARY SYSTEM 1183
25.6Tubular Reabsorption
The kidney regulates water recovery and blood pressure by producing the enzyme renin. It is renin that starts a series of
reactions, leading to the production of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and the salt-retaining steroid aldosterone. Water
recoveryisalsopowerfullyanddirectlyinfluencedbythehormoneADH.Evenso,itonlyinfluencesthelast10percentof
wateravailableforrecoveryafterfiltrationattheglomerulus,because90percentofwaterisrecoveredbeforereachingthe
collectingducts.Dependingonthebody’sfluidstatusatanygiventime,thecollectingductscanrecovernoneoralmostall
of the water reaching them.
Mechanismsofsoluterecoveryincludeactivetransport,simplediffusion,andfacilitateddiffusion.Mostfilteredsubstances
are reabsorbed. Urea, NH3, creatinine, and some drugs are filtered or secreted as wastes. H+ and HCO3– are secreted
or reabsorbed as needed to maintain acid–base balance. Movement of water from the glomerulus is primarily due to
pressure, whereas that of peritubular capillaries and vasa recta is due to osmolarity and concentration gradients. The
PCT is the most metabolically active part of the nephron and uses a wide array of protein micromachines to maintain
homeostasis—symporters, antiporters, and ATPase active transporters—in conjunction with diffusion, both simple and
facilitated. Almost 100 percent of glucose, amino acids, and vitamins are recovered in the PCT. Bicarbonate (HCO3–)
is recovered using the same enzyme, carbonic anhydrase (CA), found in erythrocytes. The recovery of solutes creates
an osmotic gradient to promote the recovery of water. The descending loop of the juxtaglomerular nephrons reaches an
osmolarity of up to 1200 mOsmol/kg, promoting the recovery of water. The ascending loop is impervious to water but
actively recovers Na+, reducing filtrate osmolarity to 50–100 mOsmol/kg. The descending and ascending loop and vasa
recta form a countercurrent multiplier system to increase Na+ concentration in the kidney medulla. The collecting ducts
activelypumpureaintothemedulla,furthercontributingtothehighosmoticenvironment.Thevasarectarecoverthesolute
andwaterinthemedulla,returningthemtothecirculation.Nearly90percentofwaterisrecoveredbeforetheformingurine
reaches the DCT, which will recover another 10 percent. Calciumrecovery in the DCT is influenced by PTH and active
vitamin D. In the collecting ducts, ADH stimulates aquaporin channel insertion to increase water recovery and thereby
regulate osmolarity of the blood. Aldosterone stimulates Na+recovery by the collecting duct.
25.7Regulation of Renal Blood Flow
Thekidneysareinnervatedbysympatheticnervesoftheautonomicnervoussystem.Sympatheticnervousactivitydecreases
blood flow to the kidney, making more blood available to other areas of the body during times of stress. The arteriolar
myogenicmechanismmaintainsasteadybloodflowbycausingarteriolarsmoothmuscletocontractwhenbloodpressure
increasesandcausingittorelaxwhenbloodpressuredecreases.Tubuloglomerularfeedbackinvolvesparacrinesignalingat
the JGA to cause vasoconstriction or vasodilation to maintain a steady rate of blood flow.
25.8Endocrine Regulation of Kidney Function
Endocrine hormones act from a distance and paracrine hormones act locally. The renal enzyme renin converts
angiotensinogenintoangiotensinI.Thelungenzyme,ACE,convertsangiotensinIintoactiveangiotensinII.AngiotensinII
isanactivevasoconstrictorthatincreasesbloodpressure.AngiotensinIIalsostimulatesaldosteronereleasefromtheadrenal
cortex,causingthecollectingducttoretainNa+,whichpromoteswaterretentionandalonger-termriseinbloodpressure.
ADH promotes water recovery by the collecting ducts by stimulating the insertion of aquaporin water channels into cell
membranes. Endothelins are elevated in cases of diabetic kidney disease, increasing Na+ retention and decreasing GFR.
Natriuretic hormones,released primarily fromtheatriaoftheheartinresponsetostretching oftheatrial walls,stimulate
Na+excretionandtherebydecreasebloodpressure.PTHstimulatesthefinalstepintheformationofactivevitaminD3and
reduces phosphate reabsorption, resulting in higher circulating Ca++levels.
25.9Regulation of Fluid Volume and Composition
The major hormones regulating body fluids are ADH, aldosterone and ANH. Progesterone is similar in structure to
aldosteroneandcanbindtoandweaklystimulatealdosteronereceptors,providingasimilarbutdiminishedresponse.Blood
pressure is a reflection of blood volume and is monitored by baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses. When
blood pressure increases, more action potentials are sent to the central nervous system, resulting in greater vasodilation,
greater GFR, and more water lost in the urine. ANH is released by the cardiomyocytes when blood pressure increases,
causingNa+andwaterloss.ADHathighlevelscausesvasoconstrictioninadditiontoitsactiononthecollectingductsto
recovermorewater.Diureticsincreaseurinevolume.MechanismsforcontrollingNa+concentrationinthebloodinclude
therenin–angiotensin–aldosteronesystemandADH.WhenNa+isretained,K+isexcreted;whenNa+islost,K+isretained.
When circulating Ca++ decreases, PTH stimulates the reabsorption ofCa++ and inhibits reabsorption of HPO2− .pHis

26.1 | Body Fluids and Fluid Compartments
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the importance of water in the body
• Contrast the composition of the intracellular fluid with that of the extracellular fluid
• Explain the importance of protein channels in the movement of solutes
• Identify the causes and symptoms of edema
The chemical reactions of life take place in aqueous solutions. The dissolved substances in a solution are called solutes.
In the human body, solutes vary in different parts of the body, but may include proteins—including those that transport
lipids,carbohydrates,and,veryimportantly,electrolytes.Ofteninmedicine,amineraldissociatedfromasaltthatcarriesan
electricalcharge(anion)iscalledandelectrolyte.Forinstance,sodiumions(Na+)andchlorideions(Cl-)areoftenreferred
to as electrolytes.
Inthebody,watermovesthroughsemi-permeablemembranesofcellsandfromonecompartmentofthebodytoanother
by a process called osmosis. Osmosis is basically the diffusion of water from regions of higher concentration to regions
of lower concentration, along an osmotic gradient across a semi-permeable membrane. As a result, water will move into
andoutofcellsandtissues,dependingontherelativeconcentrationsofthewaterandsolutesfoundthere.Anappropriate
balance of solutes inside and outside of cells must be maintained to ensure normal function.
Body Water Content
Human beings are mostly water, ranging from about 75 percent of body mass in infants to about 50–60 percent in adult
men and women, to as low as 45 percent in old age. The percent of body water changes with development, because the
proportions of the body given over to each organ and to muscles, fat, bone, and other tissues change from infancy to
adulthood(Figure26.2).Yourbrainandkidneyshavethehighestproportionsofwater,whichcomposes80–85percentof
their masses. In contrast, teeth have the lowest proportion of water, at 8–10 percent.

fluid has two primary constituents: the fluid component of the blood (called plasma) and the interstitial fluid (IF) that
surrounds all cells not in the blood (Figure 26.3).
1190 CHAPTER 26 | FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND ACID-BASE BALANCE
Figure 26.3 Fluid Compartments in the Human Body The intracellular fluid (ICF) is the fluid within cells. The
interstitial fluid (IF) is part of the extracellular fluid (ECF) between the cells. Blood plasma is the second part of the
ECF. Materials travel between cells and the plasma in capillaries through the IF.

of fluid (Figure 26.4). This fluid volume tends to be very stable, because the amount of water in living cells is closely
regulated. If the amount of water inside a cell falls to a value that is too low, the cytosol becomes too concentrated with
solutes to carry on normal cellular activities; if too much water enters a cell, the cell may burst and be destroyed.

Composition of Body Fluids
The compositions of the two components of the ECF—plasma and IF—are more similar to each other than either is to
the ICF (Figure 26.5). Blood plasma has high concentrations of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and protein. The IF has
high concentrations of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate, but a relatively lower concentration of protein. In contrast, the
ICFhaselevatedamountsofpotassium,phosphate,magnesium,andprotein.Overall,theICFcontainshighconcentrations
of potassium and phosphate (HPO2− ), whereas both plasma and the ECF contain high concentrations of sodium and

Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/dynamicfluid) to see an explanation of the dynamics of fluid in the
body’s compartments. What happens in the tissue when capillary blood pressure is less than osmotic pressure?

Fluid also moves between compartments along an osmotic gradient. Recall that an osmotic gradient is produced by the
difference in concentration of all solutes on either side of a semi-permeable membrane. The magnitude of the osmotic
gradientisproportionaltothedifferenceintheconcentrationofsolutesononesideofthecellmembranetothatontheother

byosmosisfromplasmatotheIF(andthereverse)andfromtheIFtotheICF(andthereverse).Inthebody,watermoves
constantly into and out of fluid compartments as conditions change in different parts of the body.
For example, if you are sweating, you will lose water through your skin. Sweating depletes your tissues of water and
increasesthesoluteconcentrationinthosetissues.Asthishappens,waterdiffusesfromyourbloodintosweatglandsand
surrounding skin tissues that have become dehydrated because of the osmotic gradient. Additionally, as water leaves the

Passive transport of a molecule or ion depends on its ability to pass through the membrane, as well as the existence of
a concentration gradient that allows the molecules to diffuse from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower
concentration. Some molecules, like gases, lipids, and water itself (which also utilizes water channels in the membrane
calledaquaporins),slipfairlyeasilythroughthecellmembrane;others,includingpolarmoleculeslikeglucose,aminoacids,
and ions do not. Some of these molecules enter and leave cells using facilitated transport, whereby the molecules move
downaconcentrationgradientthroughspecificproteinchannelsinthemembrane.Thisprocessdoesnotrequireenergy.For
example, glucose is transferred into cells by glucose transporters that use facilitated transport (Figure 26.8).

Fluid Balance: Edema
Edema is the accumulation of excess water in the tissues. It is most common in the soft tissues of the extremities.
Thephysiologicalcausesofedemaincludewaterleakagefrombloodcapillaries.Edemaisalmostalwayscausedby

resulting in edema.

26.2 | Water Balance
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain how water levels in the body influence the thirst cycle
• Identify the main route by which water leaves the body
• Describe the role of ADH and its effect on body water levels
• Define dehydration and identify common causes of dehydration
Onatypicalday,theaverageadultwilltakeinabout2500mL(almost3quarts)ofaqueousfluids.Althoughmostofthe
intake comes through the digestive tract, about 230 mL (8 ounces) per day is generated metabolically, in the last steps
of aerobic respiration. Additionally, each day about the same volume (2500 mL) of water leaves the body by different
routes; most of this lost water is removed as urine. The kidneys also can adjust blood volume though mechanisms that

Drinking water is considered voluntary. So how is water intake regulated by the body? Consider someone who is
experiencing dehydration,anetlossofwater that results ininsufficient water inbloodandothertissues. Thewater that
leaves the body, as exhaled air, sweat, or urine, is ultimately extracted from blood plasma. As the blood becomes more

Role of ADH
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, controls the amount of water reabsorbed from the collecting
ductsandtubulesinthekidney.Thishormoneisproducedinthehypothalamusandisdeliveredtotheposteriorpituitaryfor
storageandrelease(Figure26.11).Whentheosmoreceptorsinthehypothalamusdetectanincreaseintheconcentrationof
blood plasma, the hypothalamus signals the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary into the blood.

ADHhastwomajoreffects.Itconstrictsthearteriolesintheperipheralcirculation,whichreducestheflowofbloodtothe
extremities and thereby increases the blood supply to the core of the body. ADH also causes the epithelial cells that line
the renal collecting tubules to move water channel proteins, called aquaporins, from the interior of the cells to the apical
surface, where these proteins are inserted into the cell membrane (Figure 26.12). The result is an increase in the water
permeability of these cells and, thus, a large increase in water passage from the urine through the walls of the collecting
tubules,leadingtomorereabsorptionofwaterintothebloodstream.Whenthebloodplasmabecomeslessconcentratedand

A diuretic is a compound that increases urine output and therefore decreases water conservation by the body. Diuretics
areusedtotreathypertension,congestiveheartfailure,andfluidretentionassociatedwithmenstruation.Alcoholactsasa
diuretic by inhibiting the release of ADH. Additionally, caffeine, when consumed in high concentrations, acts as a diuretic.
26.3 | Electrolyte Balance
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• List the role of the six most important electrolytes in the body
• Name the disorders associated with abnormally high and low levels of the six electrolytes
• Identify the predominant extracellular anion
• Describe the role of aldosterone on the level of water in the body
The body contains a large variety of ions, or electrolytes, which perform a variety of functions. Some ions assist in the
transmission of electrical impulses along cell membranes in neurons and muscles. Other ions help to stabilize protein
structuresinenzymes.Stillothersaidinreleasinghormonesfromendocrineglands.Alloftheionsinplasmacontributeto
the osmotic balance that controls the movement of water between cells and their environment.
Electrolytes in living systems include sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, copper,
zinc, iron, manganese, molybdenum, copper, and chromium. In terms of body functioning, six electrolytes are most
important: sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, and phosphate.

and acidosis, either metabolic acidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis.
A relative decrease in blood sodium can occur because of an imbalance of sodium in one of the body’s other fluid
compartments, like IF, or from a dilution of sodium due to water retention related to edema or congestive heart failure.

Hypernatremia is an abnormal increase of blood sodium. It can result from water loss from the blood, resulting in the
hemoconcentration of all blood constituents. Hormonal imbalances involving ADH and aldosterone may also result in
higher-than-normal sodium values.
Potassium
Potassiumisthemajorintracellularcation.Ithelpsestablishtherestingmembranepotentialinneuronsandmusclefibers
after membrane depolarization and action potentials. In contrast to sodium, potassium has very little effect on osmotic
pressure. The low levels of potassium in blood and CSF are due to the sodium-potassium pumps in cell membranes,
which maintain the normal potassium concentration gradients between the ICF and ECF. The recommendation for daily

Hypokalemia is an abnormally low potassium blood level. Similar to the situation with hyponatremia, hypokalemia can
occur because of either an absolute reduction of potassium in the body or a relative reduction of potassium in the blood

Bicarbonate
Bicarbonate is the second most abundant anion in the blood. Its principal function is to maintain your body’s acid-base
balance by being part of buffer systems. This role will be discussed in a different section.
Bicarbonate ionsresultfromachemical reactionthatstartswithcarbondioxide(CO2)andwater,twomolecules thatare
produced at the end of aerobic metabolism. Only a small amount of CO2 can be dissolved in body fluids. Thus, over 90
percent of the CO2is converted into bicarbonate ions, HCO3–, through the following reactions:

Regulation of Calcium and Phosphate
Calcium and phosphate are both regulated through the actions of three hormones: parathyroid hormone (PTH),
dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), and calcitonin. All three are released or synthesized in response to the blood levels of
calcium.
PTHisreleasedfromtheparathyroidglandinresponsetoadecreaseintheconcentrationofbloodcalcium.Thehormone
activates osteoclasts to break down bone matrix and release inorganic calcium-phosphate salts. PTH also increases the
gastrointestinalabsorptionofdietarycalciumbyconvertingvitaminDintodihydroxyvitaminD(calcitriol),anactiveform
of vitamin D that intestinal epithelial cells require to absorb calcium.
PTH raises blood calcium levels by inhibiting the loss of calcium through the kidneys. PTH also increases the loss of
phosphate through the kidneys.
Calcitonin isreleased fromthethyroidglandinresponsetoelevated bloodlevels ofcalcium. Thehormoneincreases the
activity of osteoblasts, which remove calcium from the blood and incorporate calcium into the bony matrix.

Buffer Systems in the Body
Thebuffersystemsinthehumanbodyareextremelyefficient,anddifferentsystemsworkatdifferentrates.Ittakesonly
seconds for the chemical buffers in the blood to make adjustments to pH. The respiratory tract can adjust the blood pH
upward in minutes by exhaling CO2 from the body. The renal system can also adjust blood pH through the excretion of
hydrogen ions (H+) and the conservation of bicarbonate, but this process takes hours to days to have an effect.
The buffer systems functioning in blood plasma include plasma proteins, phosphate, and bicarbonate and carbonic acid
buffers. The kidneys help control acid-base balance by excreting hydrogen ions and generating bicarbonate that helps
maintain blood plasma pH within a normal range. Protein buffer systems work predominantly inside cells.
Protein Buffers in Blood Plasma and Cells
Nearlyallproteinscanfunctionasbuffers.Proteinsaremadeupofaminoacids,whichcontainpositivelychargedamino
groupsandnegativelychargedcarboxylgroups.Thechargedregionsofthesemoleculescanbindhydrogenandhydroxyl
ions, and thus function as buffers. Buffering by proteins accounts for two-thirds of the buffering power of the blood and
most of the buffering within cells.

and are summarized below:
• Step 1: Sodium ions are reabsorbed from the filtrate in exchange for H+ by an antiport mechanism in the apical
membranes of cells lining the renal tubule.
• Step 2: The cells produce bicarbonate ions that can be shunted to peritubular capillaries.

Figure 26.17 Conservation of Bicarbonate in the Kidney Tubular cells are not permeable to bicarbonate; thus,
bicarbonate is conserved rather than reabsorbed. Steps 1 and 2 of bicarbonate conservation are indicated.
It is also possible that salts in the filtrate, such as sulfates, phosphates, or ammonia, will capture hydrogen ions. If
this occurs, the hydrogen ions will not be available to combine with bicarbonate ions and produce CO2. In such cases,
bicarbonateionsarenotconservedfromthefiltratetotheblood,whichwillalsocontributetoapHimbalanceandacidosis.

• Identify the source of compensation for blood pH problems of a respiratory origin
• Identify the source of compensation for blood pH problems of a metabolic/renal origin

can progress to unconsciousness), tingling or numbness in the extremities, muscle twitching and spasm, and nausea and

As discussed earlier in this chapter, the concentration of carbonic acid in the blood is dependent on the level of CO2 in
thebodyandtheamountofCO2gasexhaledthroughthelungs.Thus,therespiratorycontributiontoacid-basebalanceis
usually discussed in terms of CO2 (rather than of carbonic acid). Remember that a molecule of carbonic acid is lost for
every molecule of CO2exhaled, and a molecule of carbonic acid is formed for every molecule of CO2retained.

Figure 26.18 Symptoms of Acidosis and Alkalosis Symptoms of acidosis affect several organ systems. Both
acidosis and alkalosis can be diagnosed using a blood test.
Metabolic Acidosis: Primary Bicarbonate Deficiency
Metabolic acidosis occurs when the blood is too acidic (pH below 7.35) due to too little bicarbonate, a condition called
primary bicarbonate deficiency. At the normal pH of 7.40, the ratio of bicarbonate to carbonic acid buffer is 20:1. If a
person’sbloodpHdropsbelow7.35,thenheorsheisinmetabolicacidosis.Themostcommoncauseofmetabolicacidosis
is the presence of organic acids or excessive ketones in the blood.Table 26.2lists some other causes of metabolic acidosis.

due to extreme emotional upset or fear, fever, infections, hypoxia, or abnormally high levels of catecholamines, such as
epinephrine andnorepinephrine. Surprisingly,aspirin overdose—salicylate toxicity—can result inrespiratory alkalosis as
the body tries to compensate for initial acidosis.

What effect does high altitude have on blood pH, and why?
Compensation Mechanisms
Various compensatory mechanisms exist to maintain blood pH within a narrow range, including buffers, respiration, and
renal mechanisms. Although compensatory mechanisms usually work very well, when one of these mechanisms is not
workingproperly(likekidneyfailureorrespiratorydisease),theyhavetheirlimits.IfthepHandbicarbonatetocarbonic
acid ratio are changed too drastically, the body may not be able to compensate. Moreover, extreme changes in pH can
denatureproteins.Extensivedamagetoproteinsinthiswaycanresultindisruptionofnormalmetabolicprocesses,serious
tissue damage, and ultimately death.
Respiratory Compensation
RespiratorycompensationformetabolicacidosisincreasestherespiratoryratetodriveoffCO2andreadjustthebicarbonate
tocarbonicacidratiotothe20:1level.Thisadjustmentcanoccurwithinminutes.Respiratorycompensationformetabolic
alkalosis is not as adept as its compensation for acidosis. The normal response of the respiratory system to elevated pH
is to increase the amount of CO2 in the blood by decreasing the respiratory rate to conserve CO2. There is a limit to the
decreaseinrespiration,however,thatthebodycantolerate.Hence,therespiratoryrouteislessefficientatcompensatingfor
metabolic alkalosis than for acidosis.
Metabolic Compensation
Metabolic and renal compensation for respiratory diseases that can create acidosis revolves around the conservation of
bicarbonate ions. In cases of respiratory acidosis, the kidney increases the conservation of bicarbonate and secretion of
1212 CHAPTER 26 | FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND ACID-BASE BALANCE
H+ through the exchange mechanism discussed earlier. These processes increase the concentration of bicarbonate in the
blood,reestablishingtheproperrelativeconcentrationsofbicarbonateandcarbonicacid.Incasesofrespiratoryalkalosis,
thekidneysdecreasetheproductionofbicarbonateandreabsorbH+fromthetubularfluid.Theseprocessescanbelimited
by the exchange of potassium by the renal cells, which use a K+-H+exchange mechanism (antiporter).
Diagnosing Acidosis and Alkalosis
Lab tests for pH, CO2 partial pressure (pCO2), and HCO3– can identify acidosis and alkalosis, indicating whether the
imbalance is respiratory or metabolic, and the extent to which compensatory mechanisms are working. The blood pH
value, as shown in Table 26.3, indicates whether the blood is in acidosis, the normal range, or alkalosis. The pCO2 and
totalHCO3–valuesaidindeterminingwhethertheconditionismetabolicorrespiratory,andwhetherthepatienthasbeen
able to compensate for the problem. Table 26.3 lists the conditions and laboratory results that can be used to classify
theseconditions.Metabolicacid-baseimbalancestypicallyresultfromkidneydisease,andtherespiratorysystemusually

androgens, such as testosterone, and are active throughout the reproductive lifespan of the male.

The tightly coiled seminiferous tubules form the bulk of each testis. They are composed of developing sperm cells

to 20 efferent ductules that cross the tunica albuginea.
Inside the seminiferous tubules are six different cell types. These include supporting cells called sustentacular cells, as
well as five types of developing sperm cells called germ cells. Germ cell development progresses from the basement
membrane—at the perimeter of the tubule—toward the lumen. Let’s look more closely at these cell types.
Sertoli Cells
Surrounding all stages of the developing sperm cells are elongate, branching Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells are a type of

The process of spermatogenesis begins with mitosis of the diploid spermatogonia (Figure 27.5). Because these cells are
diploid(2n),theyeachhaveacompletecopyofthefather’sgeneticmaterial,or46chromosomes.However,maturegametes
are haploid (1n), containing 23 chromosomes—meaning that daughter cells of spermatogonia must undergo a second
cellular division through the process of meiosis.

then stored in the tail of the epididymis (the final section) until ejaculation occurs.
Duct System
During ejaculation, sperm exit the tail of the epididymis and are pushed by smooth muscle contraction to the ductus
deferens (also called the vas deferens). The ductus deferens is a thick, muscular tube that is bundled together inside the
scrotumwithconnectivetissue,bloodvessels,andnervesintoastructurecalledthespermaticcord(seeFigure27.2and
Figure 27.3). Because the ductus deferens is physically accessible within the scrotum, surgical sterilization to interrupt
sperm delivery can be performed by cutting and sealing a small section of the ductus (vas) deferens. This procedure is
calledavasectomy,anditisaneffectiveformofmalebirthcontrol.Althoughitmaybepossibletoreverseavasectomy,

Prostate Gland
As shown in Figure 27.2, the centrally located prostate gland sits anterior to the rectum at the base of the bladder
surrounding the prostatic urethra (the portion of the urethra that runs within the prostate). About the size of a walnut,
the prostate is formed of both muscular and glandular tissues. It excretes an alkaline, milky fluid to the passing seminal
fluid—now called semen—that is critical to first coagulate and then decoagulate the semen following ejaculation. The

enlargement does not usually cause problems; however, abnormal growth of the prostate, or benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH), can cause constriction of the urethra as it passes through the middle of the prostate gland, leading to a number
of lower urinary tract symptoms, such as a frequent and intense urge to urinate, a weak stream, and a sensation that the

Another common disorder involving the prostate is prostate cancer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. However, some forms of prostate cancer
grow very slowly and thus may not ever require treatment. Aggressive forms of prostate cancer, in contrast, involve
metastasis to vulnerable organs like the lungs and brain. There is no link between BPH and prostate cancer, but the

reduced blood return from the penis is erection. Depending on the flaccid dimensions of a penis, it can increase in size
slightly or greatly during erection, with the average length of an erect penis measuring approximately 15 cm.
Male Reproductive System
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a condition in which a man has difficulty either initiating or maintaining an erection.
Thecombinedprevalenceofminimal,moderate,andcompleteEDisapproximately40percentinmenatage40,and
reaches nearly 70 percent by 70 years of age. In addition to aging, ED is associated with diabetes, vascular disease,
psychiatricdisorders,prostatedisorders,theuseofsomedrugssuchascertainantidepressants,andproblemswiththe
testesresultinginlowtestosteroneconcentrations.Thesephysicalandemotionalconditionscanleadtointerruptions
in the vasodilation pathway and result in an inability to achieve an erection.
Recall that the release of NO induces relaxation of the smooth muscles that surround the penile arteries, leading
to the vasodilation necessary to achieve an erection. To reverse the process of vasodilation, an enzyme called
phosphodiesterase (PDE) degrades a key component of the NO signaling pathway called cGMP. There are several
different forms of this enzyme, and PDE type 5 is the type of PDE found in the tissues of the penis. Scientists
discovered that inhibiting PDE5 increases blood flow, and allows vasodilation of the penis to occur.
PDEs and the vasodilation signaling pathway are found in the vasculature in other parts of the body. In the 1990s,
clinical trials of a PDE5 inhibitor called sildenafil were initiated to treat hypertension and angina pectoris (chest
paincausedbypoorbloodflowthroughtheheart).Thetrialshowedthatthedrugwasnoteffectiveattreatingheart

the FDA approved the drug, marketed as Viagra®. Since approval of the drug, sildenafil and similar PDE inhibitors
now generate over a billion dollars a year in sales, and are reported to be effective in treating approximately 70
to 85 percent of cases of ED. Importantly, men with health problems—especially those with cardiac disease taking

Testosterone
Testosterone,anandrogen,isasteroidhormoneproducedbyLeydigcells.ThealternatetermforLeydigcells,interstitial
cells, reflects their location between the seminiferous tubules in the testes. In male embryos, testosterone is secreted
by Leydig cells by the seventh week of development, with peak concentrations reached in the second trimester. This

concentrations are low. They increase during puberty, activating characteristic physical changes and initiating
spermatogenesis.
Functions of Testosterone

because the end products of the pathway, testosterone and inhibin, interact with the activity of GnRH to inhibit their
own production.
The regulation ofLeydig cell production oftestosterone begins outside ofthe testes. The hypothalamus and the pituitary
gland in the brain integrate external and internal signals to control testosterone synthesis and secretion. The regulation
begins in the hypothalamus. Pulsatile release of a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the
hypothalamusstimulatestheendocrinereleaseofhormonesfromthepituitarygland.BindingofGnRHtoitsreceptorson
theanteriorpituitaryglandstimulatesreleaseofthetwogonadotropins:luteinizinghormone(LH)andfollicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH). These two hormones are critical for reproductive function in both men and women. In men, FSH binds
predominantly to the Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules to promote spermatogenesis. FSH also stimulates the
Sertolicellstoproducehormonescalledinhibins,whichfunctiontoinhibitFSHreleasefromthepituitary,thusreducing
testosteronesecretion.ThesepolypeptidehormonescorrelatedirectlywithSertolicellfunctionandspermnumber;inhibin
B can be used as a marker of spermatogenic activity. In men, LH binds to receptors on Leydig cells in the testes and
upregulates the production of testosterone.
A negative feedback loop predominantly controls the synthesis and secretion of both FSH and LH. Low blood
concentrations of testosterone stimulate the hypothalamic release of GnRH. GnRH then stimulates the anterior pituitary
to secrete LH into the bloodstream. In the testis, LH binds to LH receptors on Leydig cells and stimulates the release of
testosterone. When concentrations of testosterone in the blood reach a critical threshold, testosterone itself will bind to
androgenreceptorsonboththehypothalamusandtheanteriorpituitary,inhibitingthesynthesisandsecretionofGnRHand
LH,respectively.Whenthebloodconcentrations oftestosteroneonceagaindecline,testosteronenolongerinteractswith

same process occurs with FSH and inhibin to control spermatogenesis.
1228 CHAPTER 27 | THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM
Male Reproductive System
Declines in Leydig cell activity can occur in men beginning at 40 to 50 years of age. The resulting reduction in
circulating testosterone concentrations can lead to symptoms of andropause, also known as male menopause. While
the reduction in sex steroids in men is akin to female menopause, there is no clear sign—such as a lack of a
menstrual period—to denote the initiation of andropause. Instead, men report feelings of fatigue, reduced muscle
mass,depression,anxiety,irritability,lossoflibido,andinsomnia.Areductioninspermatogenesisresultinginlowered
fertility is also reported, and sexual dysfunction can also be associated with andropausal symptoms.
Whereassomeresearchersbelievethatcertainaspectsofandropausearedifficulttoteaseapartfromagingingeneral,
testosterone replacement is sometimes prescribed to alleviate some symptoms. Recent studies have shown a benefit
from androgen replacement therapy on the new onset of depression in elderly men; however, other studies caution
against testosterone replacement for long-term treatment of andropause symptoms, showing that high doses can
sharply increase the risk of both heart disease and prostate cancer.

outer walls of the anterior and posterior vagina are formed into longitudinal columns, or ridges, and the superior portion
of the vagina—called the fornix—meets the protruding uterine cervix. The walls of the vagina are lined with an outer,
fibrous adventitia; a middle layer of smooth muscle; and an inner mucous membrane with transverse folds called rugae.
Together, the middle and inner layers allow the expansion of the vagina to accommodate intercourse and childbirth. The

The Ovarian Cycle
Theovariancycleisasetofpredictablechangesinafemale’soocytesandovarianfollicles.Duringawoman’sreproductive
years, it is a roughly 28-day cycle that can be correlated with, but is not the same as, the menstrual cycle (discussed
shortly).Thecycleincludestwointerrelatedprocesses:oogenesis(theproductionoffemalegametes)andfolliculogenesis
(the growth and development of ovarian follicles).
Oogenesis
Gametogenesisinfemalesiscalledoogenesis.Theprocessbeginswiththeovarianstemcells,oroogonia(Figure27.11).
Oogonia are formed during fetal development, and divide via mitosis, much like spermatogonia in the testis. Unlike
spermatogonia, however, oogonia form primary oocytes in the fetal ovary prior to birth. These primary oocytes are then
arrested in this stage of meiosis I, only to resume it years later, beginning at puberty and continuing until the woman is
nearmenopause(thecessationofawoman’sreproductivefunctions).Thenumberofprimaryoocytespresentintheovaries
declines from one to two million in an infant, to approximately 400,000 at puberty, to zero by the end of menopause.
Theinitiationofovulation—thereleaseofanoocytefromtheovary—marksthetransitionfrompubertyintoreproductive
maturityforwomen.Fromthenon,throughoutawoman’sreproductiveyears,ovulationoccursapproximatelyonceevery

Therefore, even though oogenesis produces up to four cells, only one survives.

ovum can be thought of as a brief, transitional, haploid stage between the diploid oocyte and diploid zygote.
1232 CHAPTER 27 | THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM
The larger amount of cytoplasm contained in the female gamete is used to supply the developing zygote with nutrients
during the period between fertilization and implantation into the uterus. Interestingly, sperm contribute only DNA at
fertilization—notcytoplasm.Therefore,thecytoplasmandallofthecytoplasmicorganellesinthedevelopingembryoare
ofmaternalorigin.Thisincludesmitochondria,whichcontaintheirownDNA.Scientificresearchinthe1980sdetermined
that mitochondrial DNA was maternally inherited, meaning that you can trace your mitochondrial DNA directly to your
mother, her mother, and so on back through your female ancestors.
Mapping Human History with Mitochondrial DNA
WhenwetalkabouthumanDNA,we’reusuallyreferringtonuclearDNA;thatis,theDNAcoiledintochromosomal
bundles in the nucleus of our cells. We inherit half of our nuclear DNA from our father, and half from our mother.
However,mitochondrialDNA(mtDNA)comesonlyfromthemitochondriainthecytoplasmofthefatovumweinherit
fromourmother.ShereceivedhermtDNAfromhermother,whogotitfromhermother,andsoon.Eachofourcells
containsapproximately1700mitochondria,witheachmitochondrionpackedwithmtDNAcontainingapproximately
37 genes.
Mutations (changes) in mtDNA occur spontaneously in a somewhat organized pattern at regular intervals in human
history. By analyzing these mutational relationships, researchers have been able to determine that we can all trace
ourancestrybacktoonewomanwholivedinAfricaabout200,000yearsago.Scientistshavegiventhiswomanthe
biblicalnameEve,althoughsheisnot,ofcourse,thefirstHomosapiensfemale.Moreprecisely,sheisourmostrecent
common ancestor through matrilineal descent.
This doesn’t mean that everyone’s mtDNA today looks exactly like that of our ancestral Eve. Because of the
spontaneousmutationsinmtDNAthathaveoccurredoverthecenturies,researcherscanmapdifferent“branches”off
ofthe“maintrunk”ofourmtDNAfamilytree.YourmtDNAmighthaveapatternofmutationsthatalignsmoreclosely
with one branch, and your neighbor’s may align with another branch. Still, all branches eventually lead back to Eve.
But what happened to the mtDNA of all of the other Homo sapiens females who were living at the time of Eve?
Researchers explainthat,overthecenturies,theirfemaledescendantsdiedchildlessorwithonlymalechildren,and
thus, their maternal line—and its mtDNA—ended.

Again,ovarianfolliclesareoocytesandtheirsupportingcells.Theygrowanddevelopinaprocesscalledfolliculogenesis,
whichtypicallyleadstoovulationofonefollicleapproximatelyevery28days,alongwithdeathtomultipleotherfollicles.
The death of ovarian follicles is called atresia, and can occur at any point during follicular development. Recall that, a
female infant at birth will have one to two million oocytes within her ovarian follicles, and that this number declines
throughoutlifeuntilmenopause,whennofolliclesremain.Asyou’llseenext,folliclesprogressfromprimordial,toprimary,
tosecondaryandtertiarystagespriortoovulation—withtheoocyteinsidethefollicleremainingasaprimaryoocyteuntil
right before ovulation.
Folliculogenesis begins with follicles in a resting state. These small primordial follicles are present in newborn females
and are the prevailing follicle type in the adult ovary (Figure 27.12). Primordial follicles have only a single flat layer of
supportcells,calledgranulosacells,thatsurroundtheoocyte,andtheycanstayinthisrestingstateforyears—someuntil
right before menopause.
After puberty, a few primordial follicles will respond to a recruitment signal each day, and will join a pool of immature

1234 CHAPTER 27 | THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM
As in men, the hypothalamus produces GnRH, a hormone that signals the anterior pituitary gland to produce the
gonadotropinsFSHandLH(Figure27.13).Thesegonadotropinsleavethepituitaryandtravelthroughthebloodstreamto
the ovaries, where they bind to receptors on the granulosa and theca cells of the follicles. FSH stimulates the follicles to

The more granulosa and theca cells a follicle has (that is, the larger and more developed it is), the more estrogen it will
produceinresponsetoLHstimulation. Asaresult ofthese largefollicles producinglargeamounts ofestrogen, systemic

The innermost layer of the uterus is called the endometrium. The endometrium contains a connective tissue lining, the
lamina propria, which is covered by epithelial tissue that lines the lumen. Structurally, the endometrium consists of two
layers: the stratum basalis and the stratum functionalis (the basal and functional layers). The stratum basalis layer is part

The timing of the menstrual cycle starts with the first day of menses, referred to as day one of a woman’s period. Cycle
length is determined by counting the days between the onset of bleeding in two subsequent cycles. Because the average

The menses phase of the menstrual cycle is the phase during which the lining is shed; that is, the days that the woman
menstruates. Although it averages approximately five days, the menses phase can last from 2 to 7 days, or longer. As

from the corpus luteum begins the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, in which the endometrial lining prepares for
implantation (see Figure 27.15). Over the next 10 to 12 days, the endometrial glands secrete a fluid rich in glycogen. If
fertilization has occurred, this fluid will nourish the ball of cells now developing from the zygote. At the same time, the
spiral arteries develop to provide blood to the thickened stratum functionalis.

with human papillomavirus (HPV). There are over 100 related viruses in the HPV family, and the characteristics of
each strain determine the outcome of the infection. In all cases, the virus enters body cells and uses its own genetic
material to take over the host cell’s metabolic machinery and produce more virus particles.

The prevalence of cervical cancer in the United States is very low because of regular screening exams called pap
smears. Pap smears sample cells of the cervix, allowing the detection of abnormal cells. If pre-cancerous cells are
detected, there are several highly effective techniques that are currently in use to remove them before they pose a

danger. However, women in developing countries often do not have access to regular pap smears. As a result, these
women account for as many as 80 percent of the cases of cervical cancer worldwide.
In2006,thefirstvaccineagainstthehigh-risktypesofHPVwasapproved.TherearenowtwoHPVvaccinesavailable:
Gardasil® and Cervarix®. Whereas these vaccines were initially only targeted for women, because HPV is sexually
transmitted, both men and women require vaccination for this approach to achieve its maximum efficacy. A recent
study suggests that the HPV vaccine has cut the rates of HPV infection by the four targeted strains at least in half.
Unfortunately, the high cost of manufacturing the vaccine is currently limiting access to many women worldwide.

Because birth control pills function by providing constant estrogen and progesterone levels and disrupting negative

Development of the Sexual Organs in the Embryo and Fetus
Females are considered the “fundamental” sex—that is, without much chemical prompting, all fertilized eggs would
developintofemales.Tobecomeamale,anindividualmustbeexposedtothecascadeoffactorsinitiatedbyasinglegene
onthemaleYchromosome.ThisiscalledtheSRY(Sex-determiningRegionoftheYchromosome).Becausefemalesdo
not have a Y chromosome, they do not have theSRYgene. Without a functionalSRYgene, an individual will be female.
In both male and female embryos, the same group of cells has the potential to develop into either the male or female
gonads; this tissue is considered bipotential. The SRY gene actively recruits other genes that begin to develop the testes,
and suppresses genes that are important in female development. As part of this SRY-prompted cascade, germ cells in
the bipotential gonads differentiate into spermatogonia. Without SRY, different genes are expressed, oogonia form, and
primordial follicles develop in the primitive ovary.

Further Sexual Development Occurs at Puberty
Puberty is the stage of development at which individuals become sexually mature. Though the outcomes of puberty for
boysandgirlsareverydifferent,thehormonalcontroloftheprocessisverysimilar.Inaddition,thoughthetimingofthese
eventsvariesbetweenindividuals,thesequenceofchangesthatoccurispredictable formaleandfemaleadolescents. As
shown in Figure 27.18, a concerted release of hormones from the hypothalamus (GnRH), the anterior pituitary (LH and
FSH),andthegonads(eithertestosteroneorestrogen)isresponsibleforthematurationofthereproductivesystemsandthe
development ofsecondary sex characteristics, which are physical changes that serve auxiliary roles in reproduction.
The first changes begin around the age of eight or nine when the production of LH becomes detectable. The release of
LHoccursprimarily atnightduringsleep andprecedes thephysical changes ofpubertybyseveral years.Inpre-pubertal
children, the sensitivity of the negative feedback system in the hypothalamus and pituitary is very high. This means that
verylowconcentrationsofandrogensorestrogenswillnegativelyfeedbackontothehypothalamusandpituitary,keeping
the production of GnRH, LH, and FSH low.
As an individual approaches puberty, two changes in sensitivity occur. The first is a decrease of sensitivity in the
hypothalamus and pituitary to negative feedback, meaning that it takes increasingly larger concentrations of sex steroid
hormones to stop the production of LH and FSH. The second change in sensitivity is an increase in sensitivity of the
gonadstotheFSHandLHsignals,meaningthegonadsofadultsaremoreresponsivetogonadotropinsthanarethegonads
of children. As a result of these two changes, the levels of LH and FSH slowly increase and lead to the enlargement
and maturation of the gonads, which in turn leads to secretion of higher levels of sex hormones and the initiation of
spermatogenesis and folliculogenesis.
Inadditiontoage,multiplefactorscanaffecttheageofonsetofpuberty,includinggenetics,environment,andpsychological
stress. One of the more important influences may be nutrition; historical data demonstrate the effect of better and more
consistent nutrition on the age of menarche in girls in the United States, which decreased from an average age of

into primary, secondary, and tertiary follicles. Early tertiary follicles with their fluid-filled antrum will be stimulated by
an increase in FSH, a gonadotropin produced by the anterior pituitary, to grow in the 28-day ovarian cycle. Supporting

most tertiary follicles in the ovary undergo atresia (they die). One follicle, usually the one with the most FSH receptors,
survives this period and is now called the dominant follicle. The dominant follicle produces more estrogen, triggering

progesterone results in the sloughing of the inner portion of the endometrium in a process called menses, or menstruation.
The breasts are accessory sexual organs that are utilized after the birth of a child to produce milk in a process called
lactation. Birth control pills provide constant levels of estrogen and progesterone to negatively feed back on the
hypothalamus and pituitary, and suppress the release of FSH and LH, which inhibits ovulation and prevents pregnancy.

Introduction
Chapter Objectives
After studying this chapter, you will be able to:
• List and explain the steps involved in fertilization
• Describe the major events in embryonic development
• Describe the major events in fetal development
• Discuss the adaptations of a woman’s body to pregnancy
• Describe the physiologic adjustments that the newborn must make in the first hours of extrauterine life
• Summarize the physiology of lactation
• Classify and describe the different patterns of inheritance
1256 CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE
In approximately nine months, a single cell—a fertilized egg—develops into a fully formed infant consisting of trillions
of cells with myriad specialized functions. The dramatic changes of fertilization, embryonic development, and fetal
development are followed by remarkable adaptations of the newborn to life outside the womb. An offspring’s normal
developmentdependsupontheappropriatesynthesisofstructuralandfunctionalproteins.This,inturn,isgovernedbythe
genetic material inherited from the parental egg and sperm, as well as environmental factors.
28.1 | Fertilization
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the obstacles that sperm must overcome to reach an oocyte
• Explain capacitation and its importance in fertilization
• Summarize the events that occur as a sperm fertilizes an oocyte
Fertilizationoccurswhenaspermandanoocyte(egg)combineandtheirnucleifuse.Becauseeachofthesereproductive
cells is a haploid cell containing half of the genetic material needed to form a human being, their combination forms a
diploidcell.Thisnewsinglecell,calledazygote,containsallofthegeneticmaterialneededtoformahuman—halffrom
the mother and half from the father.
Transit of Sperm
Fertilization is a numbers game. During ejaculation, hundreds of millions of sperm (spermatozoa) are released into the
vagina. Almost immediately, millions of these sperm are overcome by the acidity of the vagina (approximately pH 3.8),
and millions more may be blocked from entering the uterus by thick cervical mucus. Of those that do enter, thousands
are destroyed by phagocytic uterine leukocytes. Thus, the race into the uterine tubes, which is the most typical site for
spermtoencountertheoocyte,isreducedtoafewthousandcontenders.Theirjourney—thoughttobefacilitatedbyuterine
contractions—usually takes from 30 minutes to 2 hours. If the sperm do not encounter an oocyte immediately, they can
survive in the uterine tubes for another 3–5 days. Thus, fertilization can still occur if intercourse takes place a few days
beforeovulation.Incomparison,anoocytecansurviveindependentlyforonlyapproximately24hoursfollowingovulation.
Intercourse more than a day after ovulation will therefore usually not result in fertilization.
During the journey, fluids in the female reproductive tract prepare the sperm for fertilization through a process called
capacitation, or priming. The fluids improve the motility of the spermatozoa. They also deplete cholesterol molecules
embedded in the membrane of the head of the sperm, thinning the membrane in such a way that will help facilitate the
releaseofthelysosomal(digestive)enzymesneededforthespermtopenetratetheoocyte’sexterioroncecontactismade.
Sperm must undergo the process of capacitation in order to have the “capacity” to fertilize an oocyte. If they reach the
oocyte before capacitation is complete, they will be unable to penetrate the oocyte’s thick outer layer of cells.
Contact Between Sperm and Oocyte
Uponovulation, theoocyte released bytheovaryissweptinto—and along—the uterine tube.Fertilization mustoccurin

The Zygote
Recall that at the point of fertilization, the oocyte has not yet completed meiosis; all secondary oocytes remain arrested
in metaphase of meiosis II until fertilization. Only upon fertilization does the oocyte complete meiosis. The unneeded
complementofgeneticmaterialthatresultsisstoredinasecondpolarbodythatiseventuallyejected.Atthismoment,the

zygote with all the genetic instructions it needs to develop into a human.
Most of the time, a woman releases a single egg during an ovulation cycle. However, in approximately 1 percent of
ovulation cycles, two eggs are released and both are fertilized. Two zygotes form, implant, and develop, resulting in the
birthofdizygotic(orfraternal)twins.Becausedizygotictwinsdevelopfromtwoeggsfertilizedbytwosperm,theyareno
more identical than siblings born at different times.
Much less commonly, a zygote can divide into two separate offspring during early development. This results in the birth
of monozygotic (or identical) twins. Although the zygote can split as early as the two-cell stage, splitting occurs most
commonlyduringtheearlyblastocyststage,withroughly70–100cellspresent.Thesetwoscenariosaredistinctfromeach

concentrations—prevents capacitation of the sperm. The sperm sample is also concentrated, to increase the sperm
count per milliliter.
Next, the eggs and sperm are mixed in a petri dish. The ideal ratio is 75,000 sperm to one egg. If there are severe
problems with the sperm—for example, the count is exceedingly low, or the sperm are completely nonmotile, or
incapable of binding to or penetrating the zona pellucida—a sperm can be injected into an egg. This is called
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Distinguish the stages of embryonic development that occur before implantation
• Describe the process of implantation
• List and describe four embryonic membranes
• Explain gastrulation
• Describe how the placenta is formed and identify its functions
• Explain how an embryo transforms from a flat disc of cells into a three-dimensional shape resembling a human
• Summarize the process of organogenesis
Throughoutthischapter,wewillexpressembryonicandfetalagesintermsofweeksfromfertilization,commonlycalled
conception. Theperiodoftime requiredforfulldevelopment ofafetusinuteroisreferredtoasgestation(gestare =“to
carry” or “to bear”). It can be subdivided into distinct gestational periods. The first 2 weeks of prenatal development are
referredtoasthepre-embryonicstage.Adevelopinghumanisreferredtoasanembryoduringweeks3–8,andafetusfrom
theninthweekofgestationuntilbirth.Inthissection,we’llcoverthepre-embryonicandembryonicstagesofdevelopment,
which are characterized by cell division, migration, and differentiation. By the end of the embryonic period, all of the
organ systems are structured in rudimentary form, although the organs themselves are either nonfunctional or only semi-
functional.
Pre-implantation Embryonic Development
Following fertilization, the zygote and its associated membranes, together referred to as the conceptus, continue to be
projectedtowardtheuterusbyperistalsisandbeatingcilia.Duringitsjourneytotheuterus,thezygoteundergoesfiveor

conceptus(Figure28.4).Eachdaughtercellproducedbycleavageiscalledablastomere(blastos=“germ,”inthesenseof
a seed or sprout).
Approximately 3 days after fertilization, a 16-cell conceptus reaches the uterus. The cells that had been loosely grouped
are now compacted and look more like a solid mass. The name given to this structure is the morula (morula = “little
mulberry”). Once inside the uterus, the conceptus floats freely for several more days. It continues to divide, creating a
ballofapproximately100cells,andconsumingnutritiveendometrialsecretionscalleduterinemilkwhiletheuterinelining
thickens. The ball of now tightly bound cells starts to secrete fluid and organize themselves around a fluid-filled cavity,
theblastocoel.Atthisdevelopmentalstage,theconceptusisreferredtoasablastocyst.Withinthisstructure,agroupof
cells forms into an inner cell mass, which is fated to become the embryo. The cells that form the outer shell are called
trophoblasts(trophe=“tofeed”or“tonourish”).Thesecellswilldevelopintothechorionicsacandthefetalportionofthe

Figure 28.4 Pre-Embryonic Cleavages Pre-embryonic cleavages make use of the abundant cytoplasm of the
conceptus as the cells rapidly divide without changing the total volume.
As the blastocyst forms, the trophoblast excretes enzymes that begin to degrade the zona pellucida. In a process called
“hatching,” the conceptus breaks free of the zona pellucida in preparation for implantation.

to implant; when this occurs, the blastocyst is shed with the endometrium during menses. The high rate of implantation
failure is one reason why pregnancy typically requires several ovulation cycles to achieve.

Once in the abdominal cavity, an embryo can implant into any well-vascularized structure—the rectouterine cavity

In the remaining cases, medical or surgical intervention is necessary. If an ectopic pregnancy is detected early, the
embryo’s development can be arrested by the administration of the cytotoxic drug methotrexate, which inhibits the
metabolism of folic acid. If diagnosis is late and the uterine tube is already ruptured, surgical repair is essential.
Eveniftheembryohassuccessfullyfounditswaytotheuterus,itdoesnotalwaysimplantinanoptimallocation(the
fundus or the posterior wall of the uterus). Placenta previa can result if an embryo implants close to the internal os
of the uterus (the internal opening of the cervix). As the fetus grows, the placenta can partially or completely cover

Embryonic Membranes
During the second week of development, with the embryo implanted in the uterus, cells within the blastocyst start to
organize into layers. Some grow to form the extra-embryonic membranes needed to support and protect the growing
embryo: the amnion, the yolk sac, the allantois, and the chorion.

that develop into the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac.
On the ventral side of the embryonic disc, opposite the amnion, cells in the lower layer of the embryonic disk (the
hypoblast) extend into the blastocyst cavity and form a yolk sac. The yolk sac supplies some nutrients absorbed from
the trophoblast and also provides primitive blood circulation to the developing embryo for the second and third week of
development.Whentheplacentatakesovernourishingtheembryoatapproximatelyweek4,theyolksachasbeengreatly

andthedecidualcellsarenolongerneeded.Thematureplacentaiscomposedoftissuesderivedfromtheembryo,aswell
as maternal tissues of the endometrium. The placenta connects to the conceptus via the umbilical cord, which carries
deoxygenated blood and wastes from the fetus through two umbilical arteries; nutrients and oxygen are carried from the
mothertothefetusthroughthesingleumbilicalvein.Theumbilicalcordissurroundedbytheamnion,andthespaceswithin
the cord around the blood vessels are filled with Wharton’s jelly, a mucous connective tissue.

active transport.

Although blood cells are not exchanged, the chorionic villi provide ample surface area for the two-way exchange of
substances between maternal and fetal blood. The rate of exchange increases throughout gestation as the villi become
thinner and increasingly branched. The placenta is permeable to lipid-soluble fetotoxic substances: alcohol, nicotine,
barbiturates, antibiotics, certain pathogens, and many other substances that can be dangerous or fatal to the developing

Within the first 8 weeks of gestation, a developing embryo establishes the rudimentary structures of all of its organs and
tissues from the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. This process is calledorganogenesis.
Like the central nervous system, the heart also begins its development in the embryo as a tube-like structure, connected
via capillaries to the chorionic villi. Cells of the primitive tube-shaped heart are capable of electrical conduction and
contraction. The heart begins beating inthe beginning ofthe fourthweek, although it doesnotactually pumpembryonic

Sexual Differentiation
Sexual differentiation does not begin until the fetal period, during weeks 9–12. Embryonic males and females, though
genetically distinguishable, aremorphologically identical (Figure28.16).Bipotential gonads,orgonadsthatcandevelop

degenerate. The Wolffian ducts become the vas deferens, and the cloaca becomes the urethra and rectum.
During female fetal development, the bipotential gonads develop into ovaries. The Wolffian ducts degenerate. The
Müllerian ducts become the uterine tubes and uterus, and the cloaca divides and develops into a vagina, a urethra, and a
rectum.

Other Organ Systems
During weeks 9–12 of fetal development, the brain continues to expand, the body elongates, and ossification continues.
Fetal movements are frequent during this period, but are jerky and not well-controlled. The bone marrow begins to take
over the process of erythrocyte production—a task that the liver performed during the embryonic period. The liver now

Extremely premature infants sometimes exhibit residual lanugo.
Developmental weeks 21–30 are characterized by rapid weight gain, which is important for maintaining a stable body
temperature after birth. The bone marrow completely takes over erythrocyte synthesis, and the axons of the spinal cord
begin to be myelinated, or coated in the electrically insulating glial cell sheaths that are necessary for efficient nervous
system functioning. (The process of myelination is not completed until adolescence.) During this period, the fetus grows

The fetus continues to lay down subcutaneous fat from week 31 until birth. The added fat fills out the hypodermis, and
the skin transitions from red and wrinkled to soft and pink. Lanugo is shed, and the nails grow to the tips of the fingers
and toes. Immediately before birth, the average crown-to-rump length is 35.5–40.5 cm (14–16 in), and the fetus weighs
approximately 2.5–4 kg (5.5–8.8 lbs). Once born, the newborn is no longer confined to the fetal position, so subsequent

Developing Fetus
Throughout the second half of gestation, the fetal intestines accumulate a tarry, greenish black meconium. The
newborn’s first stools consist almost entirely of meconium; they later transition to seedy yellow stools or slightly
formed tan stools as meconium is cleared and replaced with digested breast milk or formula, respectively. Unlike

28.4 | Maternal Changes During Pregnancy, Labor, and
Birth
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain how estrogen, progesterone, and hCG are involved in maintaining pregnancy
• List the contributors to weight gain during pregnancy
• Describe the major changes to the maternal digestive, circulatory, and integumentary systems during pregnancy
• Summarize the events leading to labor
• Identify and describe each of the three stages of childbirth
A full-term pregnancy lasts approximately 270 days (approximately 38.5 weeks) from conception to birth. Because it is

in terms of three trimesters, each approximately 13 weeks. During the second and third trimesters, the pre-pregnancy
uterus—about the size of a fist—grows dramatically to contain the fetus, causing a number of anatomical changes in the
mother (Figure 28.18).

Effects of Hormones
Virtuallyalloftheeffectsofpregnancycanbeattributedinsomewaytotheinfluenceofhormones—particularlyestrogens,
progesterone,andhCG.Duringweeks7–12fromtheLMP,thepregnancyhormonesareprimarilygeneratedbythecorpus

the following actions:
• They suppress FSH and LH production, effectively preventing ovulation. (This function is the biological basis of
hormonal birth control pills.)
• They induce the growth of fetal tissues and are necessary for the maturation of the fetal lungs and liver.
• They promote fetal viability by regulating progesterone production and triggering fetal synthesis of cortisol, which
helps with the maturation of the lungs, liver, and endocrine organs such as the thyroid gland and adrenal gland.
• They stimulate maternal tissue growth, leading to uterine enlargement and mammary duct expansion and branching.
Relaxin, another hormone secreted by the corpus luteum and then by the placenta, helps prepare the mother’s body for
childbirth.Itincreasestheelasticityofthesymphysispubisjointandpelvicligaments,makingroomforthegrowingfetus

The anterior pituitary enlarges and ramps up its hormone production during pregnancy, raising the levels of thyrotropin,
prolactin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Thyrotropin, in conjunction with placental hormones, increases the
productionofthyroidhormone,whichraisesthematernalmetabolicrate.Thiscanmarkedlyaugmentapregnantwoman’s

ACTH stimulates maternal cortisol secretion, which contributes to fetal protein synthesis. In addition to the pituitary
hormones, increased parathyroid levels mobilize calcium from maternal bones for fetal use.
Weight Gain
The second andthird trimesters ofpregnancy are associated with dramatic changes inmaternal anatomy andphysiology.

mother’s appetite increases, but it is only necessary for her to consume an additional 300 calories per day to support the

The downward pressure of the uterus also compresses the urinary bladder, leading to frequent urination. The problem
is exacerbated by increased urine production. In addition, the maternal urinary system processes both maternal and fetal
wastes, further increasing the total volume of urine.
Circulatory System Changes
Blood volume increases substantially during pregnancy, so that by childbirth, it exceeds its preconception volume by 30
percent, or approximately 1–2 liters. The greater blood volume helps to manage the demands of fetal nourishment and

Physiology of Labor
Childbirth,orparturition,typicallyoccurswithinaweekofawoman’sduedate,unlessthewomanispregnantwithmore
than one fetus, which usually causes her to go into labor early. As a pregnancy progresses into its final weeks, several
physiological changes occur in response to hormones that trigger labor.
First, recall that progesterone inhibits uterine contractions throughout the first several months of pregnancy. As the
pregnancyentersitsseventhmonth,progesteronelevelsplateauandthendrop.Estrogenlevels,however,continuetorise
in the maternal circulation (Figure 28.20). The increasing ratio of estrogen to progesterone makes the myometrium (the

Moreover, in the eighth month of pregnancy, fetal cortisol rises, which boosts estrogen secretion by the placenta and

Figure 28.20Hormones Initiating Labor A positive feedback loop of hormones works to initiate labor.
A common sign that labor will be short is the so-called “bloody show.” During pregnancy, a plug of mucus accumulates
inthecervicalcanal,blockingtheentrancetotheuterus.Approximately1–2dayspriortotheonsetoftruelabor,thisplug
loosens and is expelled, along with a small amount of blood.
Meanwhile,theposteriorpituitaryhasbeenboostingitssecretionofoxytocin,ahormonethatstimulatesthecontractions
of labor. At the same time, the myometrium increases its sensitivity to oxytocin by expressing more receptors for this
hormone. As labor nears, oxytocin begins to stimulate stronger, more painful uterine contractions, which—in a positive
feedbackloop—stimulatethesecretionofprostaglandinsfromfetalmembranes.Likeoxytocin,prostaglandinsalsoenhance

In addition, cervical dilation boosts oxytocin secretion from the pituitary, which in turn triggers more powerful uterine
contractions. When labor begins, uterine contractions may occur only every 3–30 minutes and last only 20–40 seconds;
however, by the end of this stage, contractions may occur as frequently as every 1.5–2 minutes and last for a full minute.

Thermoregulatory Adjustments
The fetus floats in warm amniotic fluid that is maintained at a temperature of approximately 98.6°F with very little
fluctuation. Birth exposes newborns to a cooler environment in which they have to regulate their own body temperature.

Newborns, however, do have a special method for generating heat: nonshivering thermogenesis, which involves the
breakdown of brown adipose tissue, or brown fat, which is distributed over the back, chest, and shoulders. Brown fat
differs from the more familiar white fat in two ways:
• It is highly vascularized. This allows for faster delivery of oxygen, which leads to faster cellular respiration.

28.6 | Lactation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the structure of the lactating breast
• Summarize the process of lactation
• Explainhowthecompositionofbreastmilkchangesduringthefirstdaysoflactationandinthecourseofasingle
feeding
Lactation is the process by which milk is synthesized and secreted from the mammary glands of the postpartum female
breast in response to an infant sucking at the nipple. Breast milk provides ideal nutrition and passive immunity for the
infant, encourages mild uterine contractions to return the uterus to its pre-pregnancy size (i.e., involution), and induces a
substantial metabolic increase in the mother, consuming the fat reserves stored during pregnancy.
Structure of the Lactating Breast
Mammary glands are modified sweat glands. The non-pregnant and non-lactating female breast is composed primarily
of adipose and collagenous tissue, with mammary glands making up a very minor proportion of breast volume. The
mammaryglandiscomposedofmilk-transportinglactiferousducts,whichexpandandbranchextensivelyduringpregnancy

from the lactocytes, fills the alveoli, and is squeezed into the ducts. Clusters of alveoli that drain to a common duct are
called lobules; the lactating female has 12–20 lobules organized radially around the nipple. Milk drains from lactiferous
ducts into lactiferous sinuses that meet at 4 to 18 perforations in the nipple, called nipple pores. The small bumps of the
areola(thedarkenedskinaroundthenipple)arecalledMontgomeryglands.Theysecreteoiltocleansethenippleopening

The Process of Lactation
The pituitary hormone prolactin is instrumental in the establishment and maintenance of breast milk supply. It also is
important for the mobilization of maternal micronutrients for breast milk.
Near the fifth week ofpregnancy,the level ofcirculating prolactin begins toincrease, eventually rising toapproximately
10–20 times the pre-pregnancy concentration. We noted earlier that, during pregnancy, prolactin and other hormones
prepare the breasts anatomically for the secretion of milk. The level of prolactin plateaus in late pregnancy, at a level
highenoughtoinitiatemilkproduction.However,estrogen,progesterone,andotherplacentalhormonesinhibitprolactin-
mediated milk synthesis during pregnancy. It is not until the placenta is expelled that this inhibition is lifted and milk
production commences.
After childbirth, the baseline prolactin level drops sharply, but it is restored for a 1-hour spike during each feeding to
stimulate the production of milk for the next feeding. With each prolactin spike, estrogen and progesterone also increase
slightly.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Differentiate between genotype and phenotype
• Describe how alleles determine a person’s traits
• Summarize Mendel’s experiments and relate them to human genetics
• Explain the inheritance of autosomal dominant and recessive and sex-linked genetic disorders

lies, of course, in the DNA in the sperm and oocyte that combined to produce that first diploid cell, the human zygote.
1288 CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE
From Genotype to Phenotype
Each human body cell has a full complement of DNA stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes. Figure 28.24 shows the pairs
inasystematicarrangementcalledakaryotype.Amongtheseisonepairofchromosomes,calledthesexchromosomes,
that determines the sex of the individual (XX in females, XY in males). The remaining 22 chromosome pairs are called
autosomalchromosomes.Eachofthesechromosomescarrieshundredsoreventhousandsofgenes,eachofwhichcodes
for the assembly of a particular protein—that is, genes are “expressed” as proteins. An individual’s complete genetic
makeup is referred to as his or her genotype. The characteristics that the genes express, whether they are physical,
behavioral, or biochemical, are a person’sphenotype.
Youinheritonechromosomeineachpair—afullcomplementof23—fromeachparent.Thisoccurswhenthespermand
oocyte combine at the moment of your conception. Homologous chromosomes—those that make up a complementary
pair—have genes for the same characteristics in the same location on the chromosome. Because one copy of a gene, an
allele, is inherited from each parent, the alleles in these complementary pairs may vary. Take for example an allele that
encodesfordimples.Achildmayinheritthealleleencodingfordimplesonthechromosomefromthefatherandtheallele
that encodes for smooth skin (no dimples) on the chromosome from the mother.

Over 100 years of theoretical and experimental genetics studies, and the more recent sequencing and annotation of the
human genome, have helped scientists to develop a better understanding of how an individual’s genotype is expressed
as their phenotype. This body of knowledge can help scientists and medical professionals to predict, or at least estimate,

Mendel’s Theory of Inheritance
Ourcontemporaryunderstandingofgeneticsrestsontheworkofanineteenth-century monk.Workinginthemid-1800s,
longbeforeanyoneknewaboutgenesorchromosomes,GregorMendeldiscoveredthatgardenpeastransmittheirphysical
characteristics to subsequent generations in a discrete and predictable fashion. When he mated, or crossed, two pure-
breedingpeaplantsthatdifferedbyacertaincharacteristic,thefirst-generationoffspringalllookedlikeoneoftheparents.
Forinstance,whenhecrossedtallanddwarfpure-breedingpeaplants,alloftheoffspringweretall.Mendelcalledtallness
dominant because it was expressed in offspring when it was present in a purebred parent. He called dwarfism recessive
because it was masked in the offspring if one of the purebred parents possessed the dominant characteristic. Note that
tallnessanddwarfismarevariationsonthecharacteristicofheight.Mendelcalledsuchavariationatrait.Wenowknow
that these traits are the expression of different alleles of the gene encoding height.
Mendelperformedthousandsofcrossesinpeaplantswithdifferingtraitsforavarietyofcharacteristics.Andherepeatedly
cameupwiththesameresults—amongthetraitshestudied,onewasalwaysdominant,andtheotherwasalwaysrecessive.
(Remember, however, that this dominant–recessive relationship between alleles is not always the case; some alleles are
codominant, and sometimes dominance is incomplete.)
Usinghisunderstandingofdominantandrecessivetraits,Mendeltestedwhetherarecessivetraitcouldbelostaltogetherin

then the recessive trait will be expressed in the phenotype. Individuals who have two identical alleles for a given gene,
whetherdominantorrecessive,aresaidtobehomozygousforthatgene(homo-=“same”).Conversely,anindividualwho
hasonedominantalleleandonerecessivealleleissaidtobeheterozygousforthatgene(hetero-=“different”or“other”).
Inthiscase,thedominanttraitwillbeexpressed,andtheindividualwillbephenotypicallyidenticaltoanindividualwho
possesses two dominant alleles for the trait.
It is common practice in genetics to use capital and lowercase letters to represent dominant and recessive alleles. Using
Mendel’speaplantsasanexample,ifatallpeaplantishomozygous,itwillpossesstwotallalleles(TT).Adwarfpeaplant

likelytopassdowneitheroneoftheiralleles totheiroffspringinahaploidgamete,andtheresultwillbeexpressedina
dominant–recessive pattern if both parents are heterozygous for the trait.
Because of the random segregation of gametes, the laws of chance and probability come into play when predicting the
likelihoodofagivenphenotype.Consideracrossbetweenanindividualwithtwodominantallelesforatrait(AA)andan
individualwithtworecessiveallelesforthesametrait(aa).Alloftheparentalgametesfromthedominantindividualwould

secondgeneration,inheritingoneallelefromeachparent,wouldhavethegenotypeAa,andtheprobabilityofexpressing
the phenotype of the dominant allele would be 4 out of 4, or 100 percent.
This seems simple enough, but the inheritance pattern gets interesting when the second-generation Aa individuals are
crossed.Inthisgeneration,50percentofeachparent’sgametesareAandtheother50percentarea.ByMendel’sprinciple
of random segregation, the possible combinations of gametes that the offspring can receive are AA, Aa, aA (which is the
sameasAa),andaa.Becausesegregationandfertilizationarerandom,eachoffspringhasa25percentchanceofreceiving
anyofthesecombinations.Therefore,ifanAa×Aacrosswereperformed1000times,approximately250(25percent)ofthe
offspringwouldbeAA;500(50percent)wouldbeAa(thatis,AaplusaA);and250(25percent)wouldbeaa.Thegenotypic
ratio for this inheritance pattern is 1:2:1. However, we have already established that AA and Aa (and aA) individuals all
express the dominant trait (i.e., share the same phenotype), and can therefore be combined into one group. The result is
Mendel’s third-generation phenotype ratio of 3:1.
1290 CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE
Figure 28.25 Random Segregation In the formation of gametes, it is equally likely that either one of a pair alleles
from one parent will be passed on to the offspring. This figure follows the possible combinations of alleles through
twogenerationsfollowingafirst-generationcrossofhomozygousdominantandhomozygousrecessiveparents.The

Mendel’s observation of pea plants also included many crosses that involved multiple traits, which prompted him to
formulate the principle of independent assortment. The law states that the members of one pair of genes (alleles) from a
parentwillsortindependentlyfromotherpairsofgenesduringtheformationofgametes.Appliedtopeaplants,thatmeans
thattheallelesassociatedwiththedifferenttraitsoftheplant,suchascolor,height,orseedtype,willsortindependently

Independent assortment provides for a great degree of diversity in offspring.
Mendelian genetics represent the fundamentals of inheritance, but there are two important qualifiers to consider when
applying Mendel’s findings to inheritance studies in humans. First, as we’ve already noted, not all genes are inherited in
adominant–recessivepattern.Althoughalldiploidindividualshavetwoallelesforeverygene,allelepairsmayinteractto
create several types of inheritance patterns, including incomplete dominance and codominance.
Secondly, Mendel performed his studies using thousands of pea plants. He was able to identify a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in

child, the presence or absence of a single gene disorder depends on which alleles that child inherits from his or her parents.
Autosomal Dominant Inheritance
In the case of cystic fibrosis, the disorder is recessive to the normal phenotype. However, a genetic abnormality may
be dominant to the normal phenotype. When the dominant allele is located on one of the 22 pairs of autosomes (non-
sex chromosomes), we refer to its inheritance pattern as autosomal dominant. An example of an autosomal dominant
disorder is neurofibromatosis type I, a disease that induces tumor formation within the nervous system that leads to skin
and skeletal deformities. Consider a couple in which one parent is heterozygous for this disorder (and who therefore has
neurofibromatosis),Nn,andoneparentishomozygousforthenormalgene,nn.Theheterozygousparentwouldhavea50
percentchanceofpassingthedominantallele forthisdisordertohisorheroffspring,andthehomozygousparentwould
always pass the normal allele. Therefore, four possible offspring genotypes are equally likely to occur: Nn, Nn, nn, and
nn. That is, every child of this couple would have a 50 percent chance of inheriting neurofibromatosis. This inheritance

1292 CHAPTER 28 | DEVELOPMENT AND INHERITANCE
X-linked Dominant or Recessive Inheritance
An X-linked transmission pattern involves genes located on the X chromosome of the 23rd pair (Figure 28.28). Recall
that a male has one X and one Y chromosome. When a father transmits a Y chromosome, the child is male, and when
he transmits an X chromosome, the child is female. A mother can transmit only an X chromosome, as both her sex
chromosomes are X chromosomes.
When an abnormal allele for a gene that occurs on the X chromosome is dominant over the normal allele, the pattern
is described as X-linked dominant. This is the case with vitamin D–resistant rickets: an affected father would pass the
disease gene to all of his daughters, but none of his sons, because he donates only the Y chromosome to his sons (see
Figure28.28a).Ifitisthemotherwhoisaffected,allofherchildren—maleorfemale—wouldhavea50percentchanceof

With X-linked recessive diseases, males either have the disease or are genotypically normal—they cannot be carriers.
Females, however, can be genotypically normal, a carrier who is phenotypically normal, or affected with the disease. A
daughter can inherit the gene for an X-linked recessive illness when her mother is a carrier or affected, or her father is

Other Inheritance Patterns: Incomplete Dominance, Codominance, and
Lethal Alleles
Not all genetic disorders are inherited in a dominant–recessive pattern. In incomplete dominance, the offspring express
a heterozygous phenotype that is intermediate between one parent’s homozygous dominant trait and the other parent’s
homozygousrecessivetrait.Anexampleofthiscanbeseeninsnapdragonswhenred-floweredplantsandwhite-flowered

Codominance ischaracterized bytheequal, distinct, andsimultaneous expression ofbothparents’ different alleles. This

Dominant lethal inheritance patterns are much more rare because neither heterozygotes nor homozygotes survive. Of
course, dominant lethal alleles that arise naturally through mutation and cause miscarriages or stillbirths are never
transmittedtosubsequentgenerations.However,somedominantlethalalleles,suchasthealleleforHuntington’sdisease,

The age of the father matters less because nondisjunction is much less likely to occur in a sperm than in an egg.
Whereas Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of a chromosome, Turner syndrome is caused by having just
one copy of the X chromosome. This is known as monosomy. The affected child is always female. Women with Turner
syndrome are sterile because their sexual organs do not mature.

For many genetic diseases, a DNA test can determine whether a person is a carrier. For instance, carrier status for
Fragile X, an X-linked disorder associated with mental retardation, or for cystic fibrosis can be determined with a
simple blood draw to obtain DNA for testing. A genetic counselor can educate a couple about the implications of

CHAPTER REVIEW
28.1Fertilization
Hundreds of millions of sperm deposited in the vagina travel toward the oocyte, but only a few hundred actually reach
it. The number of sperm that reach the oocyte is greatly reduced because of conditions within the female reproductive
tract. Many sperm are overcome by the acidity of the vagina, others are blocked by mucus in the cervix, whereas others
are attacked by phagocytic leukocytes in the uterus. Those sperm that do survive undergo a change in response to those
conditions.Theygothroughtheprocessofcapacitation,whichimprovestheirmotilityandaltersthemembranesurrounding

Fertilization is complete upon unification of the haploid nuclei of the two gametes, producing a diploid zygote.
28.2Embryonic Development
As the zygote travels toward the uterus, it undergoes numerous cleavages in which the number of cells doubles
(blastomeres).Uponreachingtheuterus,theconceptushasbecomeatightlypackedsphereofcellscalledthemorula,which

28.3Fetal Development
The fetal period lasts from the ninth week of development until birth. During this period, male and female gonads
differentiate. The fetal circulatory system becomes much more specialized and efficient than its embryonic counterpart.
It includes three shunts—the ductus venosus, the foramen ovale, and the ductus arteriosus—that enable it to bypass the
semifunctionalliverandpulmonarycircuituntilafterchildbirth.Thebraincontinuestogrowanditsstructuresdifferentiate.

3.4kg(7.5lbs).Embryonicorganstructuresthatwereprimitiveandnonfunctionaldeveloptothepointthatthenewborn
can survive in the outside world.
28.4Maternal Changes During Pregnancy, Labor, and Birth
Hormones (especially estrogens, progesterone, and hCG) secreted by the corpus luteum and later by the placenta are
responsible for most of the changes experienced during pregnancy. Estrogen maintains the pregnancy, promotes fetal
viability,andstimulatestissuegrowthinthemotheranddevelopingfetus.Progesteronepreventsnewovarianfolliclesfrom
developing and suppresses uterine contractility.
Pregnancy weight gain primarily occurs in the breasts and abdominal region. Nausea, heartburn, and frequent urination
are common during pregnancy. Maternal blood volume increases by 30 percent during pregnancy and respiratory minute
volume increases by 50 percent. The skin may develop stretch marks and melanin production may increase.
Towardthelatestagesofpregnancy,adropinprogesteroneandstretchingforcesfromthefetusleadtoincreasinguterine
irritability and prompt labor. Contractions serve to dilate the cervix and expel the newborn. Delivery of the placenta and
associated fetal membranes follows.

28.6Lactation
The lactating mother supplies all the hydration and nutrients that a growing infant needs for the first 4–6 months of life.
During pregnancy, the body prepares for lactation by stimulating the growth and development of branching lactiferous
ducts and alveoli lined with milk-secreting lactocytes, and by creating colostrum. These functions are attributable to the
actionsofseveralhormones,includingprolactin.Followingchildbirth,sucklingtriggersoxytocinrelease,whichstimulates
myoepithelial cells to squeeze milk from alveoli. Breast milk then drains toward the nipple pores to be consumed by the

immune defenses. Colostrum, transitional milk, and mature breast milk are ideally suited to each stage of the newborn’s
development, and breastfeeding helps the newborn’s digestive system expel meconium and clear bilirubin. Mature milk
changes fromthe beginning tothe endofafeeding. Foremilk quenches the infant’sthirst, whereas hindmilk satisfies the
infant’s appetite.

Working with pea plants, Mendel discovered that the factors that account for different traits in parents are discretely

assortment to account for the inheritance patterns he observed. Mendel’s factors are genes, with differing variants being
referred toasalleles andthose alleles being dominant orrecessive inexpression. Each parent passes oneallele forevery
gene on to offspring, and offspring are equally likely to inherit any combination of allele pairs. When Mendel crossed
heterozygousindividuals,herepeatedlyfounda3:1dominant–recessiveratio.Hecorrectlypostulatedthattheexpression
of the recessive trait was masked in heterozygotes but would resurface in their offspring in a predictable manner.

However,peroxisomescontainenzymesthatdetoxifysubstancesbytransferringhydrogenatomsandproducingH2O2,whereas
the enzymes in lysosomes function to break down and digest various unwanted materials. 35 DNA replication is said to be
semiconservative because, after replication is complete, one of the two parent DNA strands makes up half of each new DNA

similar processes of initiation, elongation, and termination. In both cases the DNA molecule must be untwisted and separated,
and the coding (i.e., sense) strand will be used as a template. Also, polymerases serve to add nucleotides to the growing DNA
or mRNA strand. Both processes are signaled to terminate when completed. 38 Transcription is really a “copy” process and

of the ankle joint, while plantar flexion increases the angle of the ankle joint. 7 The first motion is rotation (hinging) of the
mandible,butthisonlyproducesabout20mm(0.78in)ofmouthopening. 8Theshoulderjointisaball-and-socketjointthat
allows for flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, medial rotation, lateral rotation, and circumduction of the humerus. 9 The
glenoidlabrumiswedge-shapedincross-section.Thisisimportantbecauseitcreatesanelevatedrimaroundtheglenoidcavity,
which creates a deeper socket for the head of the humerus to fit into. 10 The structures that stabilize the elbow include the
coronoidprocess,theradial(lateral)collateralligament,andtheanteriorportionoftheulnar(medial)collateralligament. 11The
articular cartilage functions to absorb shock and to provide an extremely smooth surface that makes movement between bones
easy,withoutdamagingthebones. 12Anintracapsularfractureoftheneckofthefemurcanresultindisruptionofthearterial
blood supply to the head of the femur, which may lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head. 13 The articular cartilage
is thickest in the upper and back part of the acetabulum, the socket portion of the hip joint. These regions receive most of the
forcefromtheheadofthefemurduringwalkingandrunning. 14Therearefiveligamentsassociatedwiththekneejoint.The
tibial collateral ligament is located on the medial side of the knee and the fibular collateral ligament is located on the lateral
side.Theanteriorandposteriorcruciateligamentsarelocatedinsidethekneejoint. 15Theanteriorcruciateligamentprevents

during a twisting motion or when side standing or landing from a jump. 17 The ligaments of the lateral ankle are the anterior
and posterior talofibular ligaments and the calcaneofibular ligament. These ligaments support the ankle joint and resist excess
inversion of the foot. 18 Because of the square shape of the ankle joint, it has been compared to a mortise-and-tendon type
of joint. 19 An inversion ankle sprain may injure all three ligaments located on the lateral side of the ankle. The sequence of

A bands and light I bands repeat along myofibrils, and the alignment of myofibrils in the cell cause the entire cell to appear

in muscle stiffness. In a live person, this can cause a condition like “writer’s cramps.” In a recently dead person, it results in
rigor mortis. 38 Eyes require fine movements and a high degree of control, which is permitted by having fewer muscle fibers

to convey information from one part of the body to a distant part of the body. Hormones are released from the endocrine cell
into the extracellular environment, but then travel in the bloodstream to target tissues. This communication and response can
takesecondstodays.Incontrast,neuronstransmitelectricalsignalsalongtheiraxons.Attheaxonterminal,theelectricalsignal
prompts the release of a chemical signal called a neurotransmitter that carries the message across the synaptic cleft to elicit a
response in the neighboring cell. This method of communication is nearly instantaneous, of very brief duration, and is highly
specific. 39 Endocrine glands are ductless. They release their secretion into the surrounding fluid, from which it enters the
bloodstream or lymph to travel to distant cells. Moreover, the secretions of endocrine glands are hormones. Exocrine glands
releasetheirsecretionsthroughaductthatdeliversthesecretiontothetargetlocation.Moreover,thesecretionsofexocrineglands
arenothormones,butcompoundsthathaveanimmediatephysiologicfunction.Forexample,pancreaticjuicecontainsenzymes
that help digest food. 40 True. Neurotransmitters can be classified as paracrines because, upon their release from a neuron’s
axon terminals, they travel across a microscopically small cleft to exert their effect on a nearby neuron or muscle cell. 41 In
both cAMP and IP3–calcium signaling, a hormone binds to a cell membrane hormone receptor that is coupled to a G protein.
The G protein becomes activated when the hormone binds. In the case of cAMP signaling, the activated G protein activates
adenylyl cyclase, which causes ATP to be converted to cAMP. This second messenger can then initiate other signaling events,
suchasaphosphorylationcascade.InthecaseofIP3–calciumsignaling,theactivatedGproteinactivatesphospholipaseC,which
cleaves a membrane phospholipid compound into DAG and IP3. IP3 causes the release of calcium, another second messenger,
from intracellular stores. This causes further signaling events. 42 An intracellular hormone receptor is located within the cell.
A hydrophobic hormone diffuses through the cell membrane and binds to the intracellular hormone receptor, which may be in
the cytosol or in the cell nucleus. This hormone–receptor complex binds to a segment of DNA. This initiates the transcription
of a target gene, the end result of which is protein assembly and the hormonal response. 43 The anterior lobe of the pituitary
gland is connected to the hypothalamus by vasculature, which allows regulating hormones from the hypothalamus to travel to
the anterior pituitary. In contrast, the posterior lobe is connected to the hypothalamus by a bridge of nerve axons called the
hypothalamic–hypophysealtract,alongwhichthehypothalamussendshormonesproducedbyhypothalamicnervecellbodiesto

The pulmonary circuit consists of blood flowing to and from the lungs, whereas the systemic circuit carries blood to and from
theentirebody.Thesystemiccircuitisfarmoreextensive,consistingoffarmorevesselsandoffersmuchgreaterresistanceto
the flow of blood, so the heart must generate a higher pressure to overcome this resistance. This can be seen in the thickness
of the myocardium in the ventricles. 29 It prevents additional impulses from spreading through the heart prematurely, thereby
allowing the muscle sufficient time to contract and pump blood effectively. 30 It ensures sufficient time for the atrial muscle

edema, anemia, metabolic acidosis or alkalosis, heart arrhythmias, uremia, loss of appetite, fatigue, excessive urination, and
oliguria. 42The vasa recta and loop ofHenle are involved in countercurrent multiplication. 43The approximate osmolarities
are: CT = 300; deepest loop = 1200; DCT = 100; and collecting ducts = 100–1200. 44 Sodium concentration in the filtrate
increases when GFR increases; it will decrease when GFR decreases. 45 To excrete more Na+ in the urine, increase the flow

of the endometrial lining, marking the menses phase of the menstrual cycle. Low progesterone levels also reduce the negative
feedback that had been occurring at the hypothalamus and pituitary, and result in the release of GnRH and, subsequently, FSH
